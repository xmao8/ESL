  <h1>The Internet's Wonders</h1>
  <div class="container">
    <div class="stage-direction">
      <p>Setting: A living room or common area. ANNA is looking confused at a tablet or laptop. BEN and CHLOE enter.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue">
      <p><strong>ANNA:</strong> (sighs) This internet! Everyone says it‚Äôs so useful, but I just‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt understand it. It feels like a different language.</p>
      <p><strong>CHLOE:</strong> (Entering, looking at her phone) Hi Anna! What‚Äôs wrong? You look like you‚Äôre trying to solve a very difficult puzzle.</p>
      <p><strong>ANNA:</strong> (Gestures vaguely at the tablet) Oh, Chloe. This internet! Everyone says it‚Äôs so useful, but I just‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt understand it. It feels like a different language.</p>
      <p><strong>BEN:</strong> (Entering, carrying a book) It is a different language sometimes, Anna. But it‚Äôs a very helpful one once you learn the basics. What are you trying to do?</p>
      <p><strong>ANNA:</strong> Well, my daughter told me to "just google it" to find a recipe for chicken soup. But I clicked on so many things, and now I‚Äôm on a page about‚Ä¶ cats playing the piano. (She turns the tablet to show a funny video).</p>
      <p><strong>CHLOE:</strong> (Laughs) Oh, those videos are everywhere! That‚Äôs probably YouTube. It‚Äôs for watching videos. You can find anything there ‚Äì funny cats, music, even news!</p>
      <p><strong>ANNA:</strong> So, how do I get to the soup?</p>
      <p><strong>BEN:</strong> (Sits beside her, gently pointing) Okay, first, you need to go back to a search engine. Do you see the little 'G' icon, for Google? Or a bar at the top?</p>
      <p><strong>ANNA:</strong> (Points) This one? The colorful one?</p>
      <p><strong>BEN:</strong> Exactly! Click that. Now, in the big white box, you can type "chicken soup recipe."</p>
      <p><strong>ANNA:</strong> (Types slowly) "Chicken‚Ä¶ soup‚Ä¶ recipe." And then I press‚Ä¶ enter?</p>
      <p><strong>BEN:</strong> That‚Äôs it!</p>
      <p><strong>ANNA:</strong> Oh! Look! So many recipes! This is fast!</p>
      <p><strong>CHLOE:</strong> See? The internet is amazing for finding information. I use it every day to check the weather, read the news, and even find out what time the bus comes.</p>
      <p><strong>ANNA:</strong> Really? I always watch the news on TV.</p>
      <p><strong>BEN:</strong> Many people read news online now. It‚Äôs updated all the time, and you can read articles from all over the world. Also, for bus times, you can just type "bus schedule [your city]" into Google. It‚Äôs very convenient.</p>
      <p><strong>ANNA:</strong> Convenient‚Ä¶ yes, if you know what to do! What else? My granddaughter is always on her phone, looking at pictures of her friends. Is that the internet too?</p>
      <p><strong>CHLOE:</strong> Yes, that‚Äôs social media! Like Instagram or Facebook. It‚Äôs for sharing photos, sending messages to friends, and seeing what everyone is doing. It‚Äôs fun! I talk to my family back home using video calls on WhatsApp. It‚Äôs free!</p>
      <p><strong>ANNA:</strong> Free video calls? My family is far away! I pay a lot for phone calls.</p>
      <p><strong>BEN:</strong> Yes, that‚Äôs a big advantage of the internet. For communication, we use email for longer messages, and apps like WhatsApp for quick chats and video calls. You can see their faces!</p>
      <p><strong>ANNA:</strong> See their faces! That sounds wonderful. So, recipes, news, talking to family‚Ä¶ what else?</p>
      <p><strong>CHLOE:</strong> Oh, you can watch movies, listen to music, buy things online ‚Äì like clothes or books! I even ordered my new shoes online last week.</p>
      <p><strong>ANNA:</strong> (Eyes widen) Shoes online? Is that safe?</p>
      <p><strong>BEN:</strong> That‚Äôs a very good question, Anna. Online safety is very important. You need to make sure the website is secure ‚Äì look for the little lock icon in the web address bar. And always use strong passwords! But for finding information and communicating, the internet is generally very safe and helpful.</p>
      <p><strong>ANNA:</strong> So much to learn! But I see now. It‚Äôs like a big library, a post office, a newspaper, and a phone, all in one small box!</p>
      <p><strong>CHLOE:</strong> Exactly! And a photo album!</p>
      <p><strong>BEN:</strong> (Smiling) We can practice more next time. Maybe we can find a video on YouTube about how to make chicken soup, too!</p>
      <p><strong>ANNA:</strong> (Laughs, looking at the tablet with new interest) Now, that I would like!</p>
      <p>(ANNA continues to look at the tablet, a little less confused, a little more curious. BEN and CHLOE smile.)</p>
