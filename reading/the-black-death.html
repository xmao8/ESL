      <h2>The Black Death: A Lesson from History</h2>
      <p>The Black Death was one of the most terrible events in human history. It was a disease that spread across Europe, Asia, and North Africa during the 1300s. Between 1347 and 1351, it killed more than 25 million people in Europe—almost one-third of the population. The disease was caused by bacteria that spread through fleas living on rats. People did not understand germs at that time, so they did not know how to stop it.</p>

      <h2>How It Spread</h2>
      <p>The Black Death began in Asia and traveled along trade routes to Europe. Ships carried rats and fleas, and when the ships reached ports like Venice and Genoa, the disease spread quickly to people. Cities were very crowded, and people lived close together, often in poor conditions without clean water or good sanitation. These conditions made it easy for the disease to spread from one person to another.</p>

      <h2>Symptoms and Fear</h2>
      <p>The symptoms of the Black Death were horrible. People got high fevers, chills, and painful swelling called “buboes,” usually in the neck, armpits, or groin. Many also developed dark spots on their skin, which gave the disease its name—the <em>Black Death</em>. Most people who caught it died within a few days. It was a time of great fear, and many families lost several members in only one week.</p>

      <h2>Beliefs and Responses</h2>
      <p>Because people didn’t know the real cause, they tried many methods to cure or prevent the disease. Some believed it was a punishment from God and walked through the streets hitting themselves with sticks to show repentance. Others blamed certain groups, like foreigners or minorities, which sadly led to violence and discrimination. Doctors wore long robes and bird-shaped masks filled with herbs, hoping to protect themselves from bad air, which they thought caused the sickness.</p>

      <h2>Long-Term Effects</h2>
      <p>The effects of the Black Death were enormous. Whole towns and villages disappeared. Farmers died, and there were not enough workers to grow food. As a result, food became more expensive, and many people went hungry. However, the shortage of workers also gave surviving peasants more power. In some places, they demanded better pay and living conditions. This began to change the social system in Europe and helped bring the end of feudalism.</p>

      <h2>What We Learned</h2>
      <p>After the Black Death, people slowly began to understand more about disease and hygiene. Over time, cities became cleaner, and new laws were made about public health. The event also made people think more about science and medicine, which led to important discoveries in the centuries that followed. The Black Death was a tragedy, but it also changed history. It showed the importance of knowledge, cleanliness, and compassion in times of crisis. Today, when the world faces new diseases, we can still learn from the lessons of the past.</p>
