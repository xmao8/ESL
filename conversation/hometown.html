  <h1>The Memory of Hometown</h1>

  <div class="container">
    <div class="stage-direction">
      <p>Setting: A modern caf√© with a small table and three chairs. Maria and Liam are seated, sipping coffee. Sofia enters with her coffee.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue">
      <p><strong>SOFIA:</strong> Good morning, you two! Hope you‚Äôre enjoying the coffee.</p>
      <p><strong>MARIA:</strong> Good morning, Sofia! Yes, this place is great. I love finding little caf√©s like this in the city.</p>
      <p><strong>LIAM:</strong> (nods shyly) It‚Äôs nice. Very different from the caf√©s back home.</p>
      <p><strong>SOFIA:</strong> Ah, ‚Äúback home‚Äù! That‚Äôs a perfect topic for today. We‚Äôre going to talk about our hometowns. Maria, you first. Where are you from?</p>
      <p><strong>MARIA:</strong> I‚Äôm from Mexico City. It‚Äôs a huge, vibrant place! Millions of people, never a dull moment.</p>
      <p><strong>LIAM:</strong> (eyes widen) Wow. Millions? My town only has‚Ä¶ maybe five thousand people.</p>
      <p><strong>MARIA:</strong> Exactly! There‚Äôs always something to do: museums, concerts, incredible food. But sometimes‚Ä¶ it can feel a bit anonymous. You don‚Äôt know many of your neighbors.</p>
      <p><strong>SOFIA:</strong> I understand that. Liam, what about your hometown?</p>
      <p><strong>LIAM:</strong> I‚Äôm from a small town called Green Valley. It‚Äôs in the countryside, surrounded by hills and a river. Everyone knows everyone.</p>
      <p><strong>MARIA:</strong> (intrigued) So, no big shopping malls or skyscrapers?</p>
      <p><strong>LIAM:</strong> (smiles) No. We have one main street, a general store, and a small library. But the air is clean, and at night, you can see all the stars. And people always help each other.</p>
      <p><strong>MARIA:</strong> That sounds peaceful. A bit too quiet for me, maybe. I think I‚Äôd get bored after a week!</p>
      <p><strong>LIAM:</strong> It‚Äôs not boring! We have local festivals, hiking, fishing. And my grandmother grows the best tomatoes you‚Äôve ever tasted.</p>
      <p><strong>SOFIA:</strong> And both are important, right? Maria, what do you miss most about Mexico City when you‚Äôre away?</p>
      <p><strong>MARIA:</strong> The energy. The sound of the street, the smell of tacos cooking on every corner. The feeling that anything is possible.</p>
      <p><strong>LIAM:</strong> For me, it‚Äôs the quiet. And my grandmother‚Äôs tomatoes. And knowing that if my car breaks down, five people will stop to help.</p>
      <p><strong>SOFIA:</strong> So, both your hometowns offer something special. Maria, what do you think Liam‚Äôs town could teach your city?</p>
      <p><strong>MARIA:</strong> Maybe a little more connection. Knowing your neighbors. And fresh air!</p>
      <p><strong>SOFIA:</strong> Liam, what could your town learn from Maria‚Äôs city?</p>
      <p><strong>LIAM:</strong> Maybe more variety‚Äîrestaurants, places to spend Saturday night.</p>
      <p><strong>SOFIA:</strong> Our hometowns shape us. Do you think you‚Äôll ever live there again?</p>
      <p><strong>MARIA:</strong> I‚Äôm not sure. I love the opportunities here. But part of my heart is in Mexico City.</p>
      <p><strong>LIAM:</strong> I think I will, eventually. I miss the slower pace, the community.</p>
      <p><strong>SOFIA:</strong> That‚Äôs natural. Our hometowns are anchors‚Äîthey stay with us. Thanks for sharing!</p>
