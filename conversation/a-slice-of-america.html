  <h1>A Slice of America</h1>
  <div class="container">
    <div class="stage-direction"><p>Setting: A small community park in Chino Hills, California. Martha and Javier are sitting on a bench when Priya arrives.</p></div>
    <div class="dialogue">
      <p><strong>MARTHA:</strong> It‚Äôs a lovely afternoon, isn‚Äôt it, Javier? The sun feels so nice.</p>
      <p><strong>JAVIER:</strong> Yes, Martha. The weather here in California is very pleasant. It is one thing I like very much about living in the US.</p>
      <p><strong>MARTHA:</strong> You‚Äôve been here for about six months now, right? How are you settling in?</p>
      <p><strong>JAVIER:</strong> It is‚Ä¶ different. People are very friendly, like you, Martha, and I appreciate that. But sometimes I still feel a little lost.</p>
      <p><strong>MARTHA:</strong> What feels difficult? Maybe I can help.</p>
      <p><strong>JAVIER:</strong> Small things, sometimes. Like‚Ä¶ the way people do things. Back home, we had a much closer community. Everyone knew their neighbors. Here, people seem more‚Ä¶ independent.</p>
      <p><strong>PRIYA:</strong> (Walks up) Hi Martha! Oh, hi Javier. How are you both doing?</p>
      <p><strong>MARTHA:</strong> Priya! So nice to see you. Javier was just telling me a bit about his experiences moving here.</p>
      <p><strong>PRIYA:</strong> Oh, you‚Äôre new to the US, right Javier? Welcome! It definitely takes some time to get used to things.</p>
      <p><strong>JAVIER:</strong> Yes, it does. Martha was saying people are independent here. It is true. Sometimes I miss the feeling of everyone helping each other like a big family.</p>
      <p><strong>PRIYA:</strong> I understand that. I felt the same when I first moved here. But I‚Äôve also found that people <em>are</em> willing to help, you just sometimes need to ask. And maybe it‚Äôs not the same as back home, but there are communities here too ‚Äì through hobbies, church, volunteer work‚Ä¶</p>
      <p><strong>MARTHA:</strong> Priya‚Äôs right. I‚Äôve lived here for over twenty years, and I‚Äôve made wonderful friends through my gardening club and the neighborhood watch. It might take a little time to find your niche, Javier. What are your interests?</p>
      <p><strong>JAVIER:</strong> I enjoy playing soccer very much. And I like hiking.</p>
      <p><strong>PRIYA:</strong> Oh, there are many soccer leagues around here for adults! And the hiking trails in the nearby hills are amazing. You should check them out. I can even recommend some groups if you‚Äôd like.</p>
      <p><strong>JAVIER:</strong> Really? That would be very kind. I have been wanting to play soccer again.</p>
      <p><strong>MARTHA:</strong> See? Priya‚Äôs already helping! And there‚Äôs a hiking group that meets right here in the park every Saturday morning. They‚Äôre a friendly bunch.</p>
      <p><strong>JAVIER:</strong> This is good to know. Sometimes I just feel unsure about how to find these things.</p>
      <p><strong>PRIYA:</strong> It‚Äôs okay. Everyone feels that way when they move to a new place. Don‚Äôt be afraid to put yourself out there a little. Say hello to people, join activities that interest you. You‚Äôll build your community here.</p>
      <p><strong>MARTHA:</strong> Exactly. Chino Hills is a great place to live. Give it some time, Javier. You‚Äôll find your slice of America here.</p>
      <p><strong>JAVIER:</strong> (Smiling) Thank you, Martha. Thank you, Priya. I feel a little more hopeful now. Maybe I will check out that soccer league.</p>
      <p><strong>PRIYA:</strong> Definitely do! Maybe I‚Äôll even see you on the field sometime.</p>
      <p>(All three smile at each other, a sense of connection forming. The scene fades.)</p>
