    <h1>Hermes — Messenger of the Gods</h1>

    <main>
        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>The Swift and Clever God</h2>
            <p>In ancient Greek mythology, <strong>Hermes</strong> was the messenger of the gods. He was known for his speed, intelligence, and clever personality. As one of the younger gods on Mount Olympus, Hermes had many responsibilities. He delivered messages for <strong>Zeus</strong>, guided souls to the underworld, and protected travelers, merchants, and thieves. He moved quickly between the world of gods and humans, earning the nickname “the god of boundaries and crossings.”</p>
            <p>Hermes was the son of Zeus and the nymph <strong>Maia</strong>. From the moment he was born, he showed how clever he was. According to one story, baby Hermes escaped his cradle on his first day of life. He ran outside, found a herd of cattle belonging to his brother <strong>Apollo</strong>, and decided to steal them just for fun. To hide his tracks, he made the cows walk backward so no one could follow the trail. When Apollo discovered the trick, he was angry, but he couldn’t stay mad for long—Hermes played beautiful music on a new instrument he had invented: the <strong>lyre</strong>. Apollo was so impressed that he forgave him and traded the cattle for the instrument. This story showed Hermes’s charm, humor, and creativity.</p>
            <p>Hermes’s speed made him the perfect messenger for the gods. He wore <strong>winged sandals</strong> and a winged hat that helped him fly from one place to another. He also carried a special staff called the <strong>caduceus</strong>, which had two snakes wrapped around it. This staff became a symbol of peace and, later, of medicine and healing in modern times. Because Hermes could move freely between heaven, earth, and the underworld, he was also known as a guide for souls, helping them find their way after death.</p>
            <p>Besides being a messenger, Hermes was the god of <strong>commerce</strong> (trade), <strong>communication</strong>, and even <strong>luck</strong>. Merchants prayed to him for success in business, and travelers asked for his protection on long journeys. Although he sometimes played tricks on gods and humans, Hermes was loved for his playful nature and his ability to solve problems quickly. He represented intelligence, adaptability, and the joy of discovery.</p>
            <p>Hermes appeared in many Greek myths. He helped <strong>Perseus</strong> defeat Medusa by giving him winged sandals and a magic sword. He also rescued the infant god <strong>Dionysus</strong> and often acted as a helper to heroes. Because of his friendly attitude, Hermes was one of the few gods who could speak easily with both mortals and immortals. He enjoyed communication and was known as a bridge between worlds.</p>
            <p>To the ancient Greeks, Hermes symbolized freedom, movement, and intelligence. His quick mind and kind heart made him a protector of travelers and a friend to those who took risks or explored new ideas. Even today, his image—with wings on his feet—reminds us of the importance of speed, creativity, and the courage to cross boundaries in search of new opportunities.</p>
