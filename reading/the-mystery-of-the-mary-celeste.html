      <h2>Story</h2>
      <p>In November 1872, a ship called the <strong>Mary Celeste</strong> left New York City, sailing across the Atlantic Ocean toward Italy. On board were Captain <strong>Benjamin Briggs</strong>, his wife <strong>Sarah</strong>, their two-year-old daughter <strong>Sophia</strong>, and seven crew members. The ship was carrying barrels of alcohol as cargo. It was a strong, well-built ship, and the weather was calm when it left port. Everything seemed normal.</p>

      <p>But just one month later, on December 5, another ship called the <strong>Dei Gratia</strong> saw something strange floating in the ocean near Portugal. It was the Mary Celeste, moving slowly under full sail. The sailors called out to it but received no answer. Finally, they climbed aboard—and what they found became one of the greatest sea mysteries in history.</p>

      <p>The ship was completely empty. The lifeboat was missing, but the sails and ropes were in good condition. There were no signs of a fight, no damage from storms, and no blood. The cargo of alcohol was almost untouched, and all the crew’s belongings, including clothes and food, were still there. The captain’s logbook had stopped a week earlier, with no sign of trouble.</p>

      <p>Even more mysteriously, the ship’s last recorded location was only about 500 miles from where it was found. If the captain and crew had abandoned ship, why hadn’t they been found? And why had they left such a safe and seaworthy vessel?</p>

      <p>When the Mary Celeste was towed back to port, people began to invent theories. Some believed the crew had been drunk and mutinied against the captain, but there was no evidence of violence. Others thought pirates had attacked, yet nothing was stolen. A few suggested that an explosion from the alcohol cargo had frightened the captain and crew, causing them to escape in the lifeboat—but if so, where did they go? No lifeboat or bodies were ever found.</p>

      <p>In later years, the story of the Mary Celeste inspired many legends. Some said the crew had disappeared into a strange sea fog or triangle of magnetic forces. Others claimed they had been taken by sea monsters or aliens. These ideas were, of course, impossible—but they showed how mysterious the event seemed to people.</p>

      <p>Modern scientists believe that the barrels of alcohol may have leaked and created dangerous fumes. Perhaps the captain feared an explosion and ordered everyone into the lifeboat temporarily, tying it to the ship with a rope. But strong winds or waves may have broken the rope, separating them from the Mary Celeste forever.</p>

      <p>The ship was later repaired and continued to sail for many years, but it never lost its dark reputation. The mystery of what happened to Captain Briggs, his family, and his crew has never been solved.</p>

      <p>Even today, the Mary Celeste reminds us how vast and unpredictable the sea can be—and how some secrets may remain hidden beneath its waves forever.</p>
