<h1>Protecting the Environment: What We Can Do</h1>

<div class="container">
  <article>
    <p>The environment is everything around us ‚Äî the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the land we live on. Today, the Earth is facing serious environmental problems. These include air pollution, water pollution, climate change, and too much waste. These problems are harmful to humans, animals, and nature.</p>

    <p>One of the biggest problems is <strong>pollution</strong>. Factories, cars, and airplanes release harmful gases into the air. These gases make the air dirty and cause health problems like asthma. Water pollution is also dangerous. Trash and chemicals in rivers and oceans can kill fish and make the water unsafe to drink or swim in.</p>

    <p>Another serious issue is <strong>climate change</strong>. When we burn oil, coal, and gas, we produce carbon dioxide (CO‚ÇÇ). CO‚ÇÇ is a greenhouse gas that warms the Earth. As a result, the ice in the Arctic is melting, sea levels are rising, and weather is becoming more extreme. There are more floods, wildfires, and storms in many parts of the world.</p>

    <p>So, what can we do to help? First, we can <strong>reduce waste</strong>. Instead of using plastic bags, we can bring reusable ones. We can also recycle paper, plastic, and glass. Second, we can save energy. Turning off lights when we leave a room, using energy-saving light bulbs, and walking or biking instead of driving all help reduce pollution. Third, we can protect nature. Planting trees, cleaning up parks, and not littering all make a big difference.</p>

    <p>Governments and companies also need to help. They can make laws to reduce pollution and invest in clean energy, like solar and wind power. But each person‚Äôs actions also matter. If everyone makes small changes, together we can make a big impact.</p>

    <p>In conclusion, the environment is very important for our health and our future. We need to protect it now. By learning more and making smart choices every day, we can help the Earth stay clean and safe.</p>
