  <h1>Feeling Better</h1>

  <div class="container">
    <div class="stage-direction">
      <p>Scene: A doctor's office waiting room. Nina is at the front desk. Maria walks in slowly, holding her bag and looking worried.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="dialogue">
      <p><strong>Nina:</strong> Good morning! Welcome to Riverside Clinic. How can I help you today?</p>
      <p><strong>Maria:</strong> Hi. I have an appointment. My name is Maria Lopez. Ten o‚Äôclock.</p>
      <p><strong>Nina:</strong> (types on the computer) Yes, I see it right here. You‚Äôre right on time. Just a few questions before you see the doctor.</p>
      <p><strong>Maria:</strong> Sure.</p>
      <p><strong>Nina:</strong> Have you traveled recently? Any cough or fever?</p>
      <p><strong>Maria:</strong> No, no travel. And no fever. Just very tired lately.</p>
      <p><strong>Nina:</strong> Okay, thank you. Please take a seat. Dr. Lee will call you in a moment.</p>
      <p><strong>Maria:</strong> (sits down slowly) Thank you. I‚Äôm a little nervous. I haven‚Äôt seen a doctor in over a year.</p>
      <p><strong>Nina:</strong> That‚Äôs okay! A lot of people feel that way. But Dr. Lee is great. He listens, and he explains things clearly. You‚Äôll be in good hands.</p>
      <p><strong>Dr. Lee:</strong> (enters holding a clipboard) Maria Lopez?</p>
      <p><strong>Maria:</strong> Yes. That‚Äôs me.</p>
      <p><strong>Dr. Lee:</strong> Nice to meet you, Maria. Come on in, and we‚Äôll talk.</p>
      <p class="stage-direction">[They walk into the exam room. Dr. Lee gestures to a chair. Maria sits.]</p>
      <p><strong>Dr. Lee:</strong> So, what‚Äôs going on? How can I help you today?</p>
      <p><strong>Maria:</strong> I feel tired all the time. I also have headaches, maybe three or four times a week.</p>
      <p><strong>Dr. Lee:</strong> That sounds difficult. When did the headaches start?</p>
      <p><strong>Maria:</strong> About two months ago. At first, I thought it was just stress, but now it‚Äôs every week.</p>
      <p><strong>Dr. Lee:</strong> How is your sleep? Do you get at least six to seven hours a night?</p>
      <p><strong>Maria:</strong> Not really. I sleep maybe four hours. I wake up and can‚Äôt go back to sleep.</p>
      <p><strong>Dr. Lee:</strong> I see. Do you drink coffee or energy drinks?</p>
      <p><strong>Maria:</strong> Yes‚Ä¶ three or four cups a day. Sometimes more.</p>
      <p><strong>Dr. Lee:</strong> That could be part of the problem. Too much caffeine can affect your sleep and cause headaches.</p>
      <p><strong>Maria:</strong> I didn‚Äôt know that. I thought coffee helped me stay awake.</p>
      <p><strong>Dr. Lee:</strong> It does, but it also makes it harder to sleep well. Let‚Äôs take your blood pressure and schedule a blood test today.</p>
      <p><strong>Maria:</strong> Okay. Do you think something serious is wrong?</p>
      <p><strong>Dr. Lee:</strong> Not necessarily. Many people feel this way when they‚Äôre tired, stressed, and not sleeping. But the blood test will help us be sure.</p>
      <p class="stage-direction">[He checks her blood pressure.]</p>
      <p><strong>Dr. Lee:</strong> Your blood pressure is a little high. Nothing dangerous, but it‚Äôs good we caught it now.</p>
      <p><strong>Maria:</strong> So what should I do?</p>
      <p><strong>Dr. Lee:</strong> Try to reduce coffee to one cup a day. Drink more water. Try walking or stretching in the evening. These small changes can really help.</p>
      <p><strong>Maria:</strong> I‚Äôll try. I just want to feel like myself again.</p>
      <p><strong>Dr. Lee:</strong> You will. I‚Äôll also call you in two days with the test results.</p>
      <p class="stage-direction">[They return to the front desk. Nina looks up.]</p>
      <p><strong>Nina:</strong> All finished in the exam room?</p>
      <p><strong>Dr. Lee:</strong> Yes. Maria needs a blood test today. Can you help her with that?</p>
      <p><strong>Nina:</strong> Of course. Maria, we can do it now. It takes just a few minutes.</p>
      <p><strong>Maria:</strong> Thank you. And thank you, Dr. Lee.</p>
      <p><strong>Dr. Lee:</strong> You‚Äôre very welcome. Just remember‚Äîsmall steps. And call me if you feel worse.</p>
      <p><strong>Maria:</strong> I will. Thank you again.</p>
      <p><strong>Nina:</strong> You‚Äôre doing the right thing by coming in. Health is important!</p>
      <p><strong>Maria:</strong> Yes. I was nervous, but now I feel better. Just talking about it helps.</p>
      <p><strong>Nina:</strong> That‚Äôs what we‚Äôre here for! Come on, I‚Äôll show you where the lab is.</p>
      <p class="stage-direction">[Maria and Nina walk toward the lab. Maria looks more relaxed.]</p>
