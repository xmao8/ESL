    <h1>Apollo — God of the Sun, Music, and Prophecy</h1>

    <main>
        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>The Bright and Beautiful God</h2>
            <p>In ancient Greek mythology, <strong>Apollo</strong> was one of the most important and beloved gods. He represented light, truth, music, healing, and prophecy. Often called the god of the sun, Apollo brought warmth and order to the world. He was also known for his beauty, intelligence, and artistic talent. To the Greeks, Apollo symbolized harmony—the balance between body, mind, and spirit.</p>
            <p>Apollo was the son of <strong>Zeus</strong>, the king of the gods, and <strong>Leto</strong>, a gentle goddess. His twin sister was <strong>Artemis</strong>, the goddess of the moon and hunting. When Apollo was born, the island of Delos became bright with sunlight, and swans sang in celebration. From the moment of his birth, it was clear that Apollo was destined for greatness.</p>
            <p>One of Apollo’s greatest gifts was his love for music. He played the <strong>lyre</strong>, a small harp, which produced sweet and peaceful sounds. The instrument was said to have been given to him by the messenger god <strong>Hermes</strong>, who invented it. Apollo became the leader of the <em>Muses</em>—the nine goddesses of art, poetry, and science—and inspired artists to create beautiful works. In paintings and sculptures, he is often shown holding a golden lyre, surrounded by light.</p>
            <p>Apollo was also known as the god of <strong>prophecy</strong> and truth. His most famous temple was at <strong>Delphi</strong>, where people came from all over Greece to ask questions about the future. The priestess of Apollo, known as the <em>Oracle of Delphi</em>, would enter a trance and speak his answers. Her words guided kings, travelers, and warriors in making important decisions. Because of this, Apollo was also called the god of wisdom and reason.</p>
            <p>Another side of Apollo was his power to heal. He could cure diseases and was believed to bring health and harmony to those who honored him. However, like many gods, he could also cause harm if disrespected. In one myth, he sent a plague to punish humans who had offended him. This showed that even a god of light had a darker, more serious side.</p>
            <p>Apollo played a role in many famous Greek stories. He helped the hero <strong>Troilus</strong>, punished the giant <strong>Tityus</strong>, and guided young heroes on their journeys. He was admired for his fairness, intelligence, and love of beauty. Many cities held festivals in his honor, celebrating art, music, and health under his protection.</p>
            <p>To the ancient Greeks, Apollo represented the best of human qualities—creativity, discipline, and knowledge. He taught people to live in balance and to appreciate the beauty of both the mind and the natural world. Even today, Apollo remains a symbol of light, art, and truth—the shining ideal of wisdom and harmony that continues to inspire people around the world.</p>
