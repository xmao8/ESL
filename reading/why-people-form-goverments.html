    <h1>Why People Form Governments — John Locke</h1>

            <h2>From the State of Nature to Government</h2>
            <p>
                In the late 1600s, the English philosopher <strong>John Locke</strong> wrote a famous book called
                <em>Second Treatise of Government</em>. In it, he asked an important question: if people are born free,
                why would they ever give up some of their freedom and live under a government?
            </p>
            <p>
                Locke said that in a “<strong>state of nature</strong>,” people are free and equal. Each person is the
                “lord” of his or her own life and property. No one is born with the right to rule over others. However,
                life in this natural condition is not always safe. There is no clear law, no neutral judge, and no
                strong power to protect people. Because of this, people’s rights and property are always in danger.
            </p>
            <p>
                According to Locke, this makes people willing to leave the state of nature. They decide to join together
                in a <strong>society</strong> to protect their “lives, liberties, and estates,” which he calls
                <strong>property</strong>. The main reason people create a government is to better protect this property.
                In the state of nature, there are many things missing that are needed for real safety.
            </p>
            <p>
                First, there is no <strong>settled, known law</strong> that everyone agrees on. Even if the “law of
                nature” tells people to be fair, many people are selfish or ignorant. They may not accept that law when
                it goes against their own interests. Second, there is no <strong>neutral judge</strong> with the power
                to decide conflicts. In the state of nature, each person acts as judge in his or her own case, which
                often leads to anger, unfairness, and revenge.
            </p>
            <p>
                Third, there is no strong power to carry out fair decisions. Even if someone is clearly wrong, that
                person may use force to protect their injustice. Punishing them can be dangerous for the person who
                tries. To avoid these problems, people agree to form a <strong>community</strong> and create a
                <strong>government</strong>. When individuals freely join together, they become one “body politic” — one
                political body — and the <strong>majority</strong> then has the right to make decisions for the whole
                group. For Locke, a government is justified only because it protects the people’s rights better than the
                state of nature does.
