  <h1>The Lost Colony of Roanoke — A Historical Mystery</h1>

  <main>
    <div class="content-section">
    
      <h2>Story</h2>
      <p>More than four hundred years ago, one of the greatest mysteries in American history began. In 1587, a group of English settlers sailed across the Atlantic Ocean to start a new life in North America. Their leader was a man named <strong>John White</strong>, and they decided to build their colony on <strong>Roanoke Island</strong>, off the coast of what is now North Carolina.</p>

      <p>At first, life was difficult. The settlers had limited food and tools, and relations with local Native American tribes were tense. After a few months, John White decided to return to England to get more supplies. He promised the settlers—including his daughter, <strong>Eleanor Dare</strong>, and his newborn granddaughter, <strong>Virginia Dare</strong>, the first English baby born in America—that he would come back quickly.</p>

      <p>But when White reached England, a war had started between England and Spain. All ships were needed for fighting, so John White had to wait three long years before he could return to Roanoke. Finally, in 1590, he sailed back across the ocean to bring help to his family and friends.</p>

      <p>When he arrived at the island, everything was silent. The houses and fort were empty. There were no people anywhere—no signs of life, no signs of battle, and no bodies. The settlers had vanished. The only clue was a single word carved into a wooden post: <strong>“CROATOAN.”</strong></p>

      <p>John White believed this word might mean that the settlers had gone to <strong>Croatoan Island</strong>, now known as Hatteras Island, where a friendly tribe lived. He wanted to search there, but a storm damaged his ship, forcing him to return to England once again. He never saw the settlers again.</p>

      <p>Over the centuries, many theories have tried to explain what happened to the “Lost Colony” of Roanoke. Some believe the settlers joined local tribes and lived peacefully among them. Others think they were attacked by unfriendly tribes or pirates. A few suggest that disease or starvation wiped them out.</p>

      <p>Archaeologists and historians have searched the area for hundreds of years. Some pottery, tools, and European artifacts have been found nearby, suggesting that at least some settlers may have survived and mixed with the native people. However, no final proof has ever been discovered.</p>

      <p>The mystery continues to capture imaginations. The word “Croatoan” has appeared in books, movies, and even legends about disappearances in other parts of history. In 1937, America marked the 350th anniversary of the Roanoke Colony with plays and memorials honoring the lost settlers.</p>

      <p>Even today, visitors to Roanoke Island can walk through the forests and feel the same salty air the colonists once breathed. Standing where the small wooden fort once stood, many wonder what really happened there. Did the settlers start new lives among the tribes, or did something darker occur?</p>

      <p>No one knows for sure. The Lost Colony of Roanoke remains an unsolved mystery—a reminder that history still holds secrets waiting to be discovered.</p>
