    <h1>Mount Everest ‚Äî Roof of the World</h1>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Climbing to the Sky</h2>
            <p>Mount Everest, standing at 8,849 meters, is the highest mountain on Earth. It rises in the Himalayas, on the border between Nepal and China‚Äôs Tibet region. Known as ‚ÄúSagarmatha‚Äù in Nepali and ‚ÄúChomolungma‚Äù in Tibetan, Everest has long been a place of mystery, challenge, and spiritual meaning. Today, it is both a sacred site and a global destination for climbers.</p>
            <p>Everest was formed about 60 million years ago when the Indian plate collided with the Eurasian plate, pushing the land upward. This process continues even now, meaning Everest grows a few millimeters taller each year. Its snow-covered summit is often hidden by clouds and fierce winds. Temperatures can drop below ‚Äì40¬∞C, making survival extremely difficult.</p>
            <p>Local communities, including the Sherpa people, have lived in the Himalayan valleys for centuries. Sherpas are famous for their strength, skill, and knowledge of the mountains. Many serve as guides and porters, helping climbers reach the summit. For them, Everest is not only a mountain but also a sacred place connected to their traditions.</p>
            <p>The first successful climb to the top was achieved in 1953 by Sir Edmund Hillary of New Zealand and Tenzing Norgay, a Sherpa climber from Nepal. Their achievement became a symbol of human determination and cooperation. Since then, thousands of climbers from around the world have attempted the dangerous journey, though not all succeed. Avalanches, thin air, freezing temperatures, and sudden storms make Everest one of the most dangerous places on Earth.</p>
            <p>Despite the risks, climbing Everest remains a dream for many adventurers. Each year, hundreds of climbers set out during the spring season when weather is most stable. They must pass through several camps and spend weeks adjusting to the thin air at high altitudes. Oxygen tanks are often needed above 8,000 meters, an area known as the ‚Äúdeath zone,‚Äù where survival is extremely difficult.</p>
            <p>Everest also faces challenges from human activity. Increasing numbers of climbers have left behind trash, damaged trails, and created overcrowding near the summit. Climate change is melting glaciers and making avalanches more frequent. Efforts are now being made to protect the mountain, including clean-up campaigns and limits on the number of climbing permits.</p>
            <p>Mount Everest is more than a peak. It is a symbol of human courage, the beauty of nature, and the importance of respect for our planet. For climbers, standing on its summit means touching the sky. For the rest of us, Everest reminds us that Earth‚Äôs wonders must be preserved with care for future generations.</p>
