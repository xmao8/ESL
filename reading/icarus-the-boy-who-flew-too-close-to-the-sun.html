    <h1>Icarus — The Boy Who Flew Too Close to the Sun</h1>

    <main>
        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>The Tragic Flight of Icarus</h2>
            <p>In ancient Greek mythology, <strong>Icarus</strong> was the son of <strong>Daedalus</strong>, a famous inventor and craftsman. Daedalus was known for creating amazing machines and solving difficult problems. One of his most famous creations was the <strong>Labyrinth</strong>—a huge maze built for King Minos of Crete to hold the dangerous monster called the <strong>Minotaur</strong>.</p>
            <p>However, after helping the hero <em>Theseus</em> escape from the Labyrinth, Daedalus and his son Icarus were imprisoned by King Minos. They were kept in a high tower on the island of Crete so they could never tell the secret of the maze. But Daedalus, clever as always, began to think of a way to escape—not by land or sea, but by air.</p>
            <p>He collected bird feathers and used wax to connect them, carefully building two pairs of wings—one for himself and one for his son. When they were ready, Daedalus warned Icarus: “Fly in the middle of the sky. If you go too low, the sea will wet your wings. If you fly too high, the sun will melt the wax.” Icarus promised to obey, and together they began their flight.</p>
            <p>At first, it was wonderful. The wind lifted them, and the sea sparkled below. Icarus laughed with joy and shouted in excitement. He felt powerful and free. But as he soared higher, he forgot his father’s warning. He wanted to see how far he could go. The sun grew hotter, and the wax on his wings began to melt. Feathers fell away one by one.</p>
            <p>Realizing too late, Icarus cried out for his father, but his wings fell apart. He plunged into the blue sea below and drowned. Daedalus flew down to search for him but could only see the feathers floating on the water. Heartbroken, he named the place where Icarus fell the <strong>Icarian Sea</strong>, in his memory.</p>
            <p>The myth of Icarus teaches an important lesson about <strong>balance</strong> and <strong>wisdom</strong>. Ambition and courage are valuable, but pride and carelessness can lead to disaster. It reminds us not to ignore good advice or think we are above limits. Even today, people say someone has “flown too close to the sun” when they become overconfident and take dangerous risks.</p>
            <p>Yet, the story also celebrates human dreams and the desire to rise beyond what seems possible. Icarus’s flight shows both the beauty and the danger of seeking freedom. His story continues to inspire art, music, and literature, reminding us to dream bravely—but also wisely.</p>
