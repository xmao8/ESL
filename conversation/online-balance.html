  <h1>Online Balance</h1>
  <div class="container">
    <div class="stage-direction">
      <p>Setting: A cozy family living room with a laptop and smartphone on the table.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue">
      <p><strong>MARIA:</strong> (worriedly) Carlos, you've been online for hours today. Don't you think it's enough?</p>
      <p><strong>CARLOS:</strong> (still scrolling, distractedly) Mom, I‚Äôm doing homework and catching up with friends. Everything is online now!</p>
      <p><strong>MARIA:</strong> (sighs) I understand it's necessary, but there needs to be balance. It's not healthy to spend all your time in front of a screen.</p>
      <p><strong>CARLOS:</strong> But my friends are always online. If I'm not there, I feel like I'm missing something important.</p>
      <p><strong>MARIA:</strong> (patiently) I get it. But maybe there's a way to stay connected without constantly being online.</p>

      <p class="stage-direction">[Alex enters the room, cheerful.]</p>
      <p><strong>ALEX:</strong> Hey everyone! What's going on?</p>
      <p><strong>MARIA:</strong> Oh, hi Alex. Maybe you can help us. Carlos spends so much time online. How can we manage this better?</p>
      <p><strong>ALEX:</strong> Hmm, it's a common problem. Carlos, how do you feel after spending a long time online?</p>
      <p><strong>CARLOS:</strong> Honestly, sometimes I'm really tired, but I don‚Äôt want to miss out on things.</p>
      <p><strong>ALEX:</strong> That‚Äôs understandable. What if you set specific online hours and breaks for yourself?</p>
      <p><strong>CARLOS:</strong> (considering) Maybe. But how can I keep track?</p>
      <p><strong>ALEX:</strong> You can use a timer or even an app that reminds you to take breaks. This way, you're online but also caring for your health.</p>

      <p><strong>MARIA:</strong> (smiling) That sounds practical. Could you help him set this up, Alex?</p>
      <p><strong>ALEX:</strong> Of course! It's easy, and I think you'll both feel better about it.</p>
      <p><strong>CARLOS:</strong> (enthusiastically) Let‚Äôs try it! Thanks, Alex.</p>

      <p class="stage-direction">[Carlos pauses for a moment, thoughtful.]</p>
      <p><strong>CARLOS:</strong> But what if I ignore the reminders? It‚Äôs easy to keep going, especially when something interesting comes up.</p>
      <p><strong>ALEX:</strong> Good point! Maybe we can also plan other offline activities during your breaks. Something you enjoy doing, like basketball or reading.</p>
      <p><strong>MARIA:</strong> That's a great idea! It could encourage you to step away from the screen and do something active or creative.</p>
      <p><strong>CARLOS:</strong> (slowly nodding) I do miss playing basketball. And I have books I've been meaning to read.</p>
      <p><strong>MARIA:</strong> See? We can balance online and offline activities. It doesn‚Äôt mean you lose out, just that you choose how to spend your time wisely.</p>
      <p><strong>ALEX:</strong> Exactly! You might even find you enjoy your online activities more when you're not exhausted by overdoing it.</p>
      <p><strong>CARLOS:</strong> Alright, I think it's worth trying. Thanks, Alex. And thanks, Mom.</p>
      
      <p class="stage-direction">[Alex takes the laptop and starts demonstrating apps.]</p>
      <p><strong>ALEX:</strong> Look, Carlos, here's an app that gives reminders but also tracks your usage so you can see how long you're spending online.</p>
      <p><strong>CARLOS:</strong> Wow, it even shows how many hours I've been on different platforms?</p>
      <p><strong>ALEX:</strong> Yes! Knowing where your time goes can help you decide what's essential and what's just habit.</p>
      <p><strong>MARIA:</strong> (interested) Can it block certain apps if necessary?</p>
      <p><strong>ALEX:</strong> Yes, you can set limits for specific sites or apps. It helps you stay disciplined.</p>
      <p><strong>CARLOS:</strong> That might help me stay focused, especially during homework.</p>
      <p><strong>MARIA:</strong> Maybe we could even have certain family hours offline, like dinner time or weekends?</p>
      <p><strong>ALEX:</strong> That‚Äôs a fantastic idea. Carlos, what do you think?</p>
      <p><strong>CARLOS:</strong> (nodding, thoughtful) That could be good. I think it would be nice to have more family time without screens.</p>
      <p><strong>MARIA:</strong> (smiling warmly) I agree, Carlos. It‚Äôs important for all of us.</p>
      <p><strong>ALEX:</strong> You know, some families even schedule special activities offline, like hikes, games, or cooking sessions.</p>
      <p><strong>CARLOS:</strong> (excited) I like the idea of cooking together! We haven‚Äôt done that in ages.</p>
      <p><strong>MARIA:</strong> Perfect! Let‚Äôs start planning a family cooking night for the weekend.</p>
      <p><strong>ALEX:</strong> Awesome! Balance isn‚Äôt just about reducing online time; it‚Äôs about enriching your life offline too.</p>
      <p><strong>CARLOS:</strong> Thank you both. I feel better already just thinking about it.</p>
      <p><strong>MARIA:</strong> Me too, Carlos. Thanks for helping us, Alex.</p>
      <p><strong>ALEX:</strong> My pleasure! Now, let's get started!</p>
      <p>(All three laugh and continue enthusiastically planning their new online-offline balance.)</p>
