    <p>Imagine a vast, unknown land stretching west, full of mountains, rivers, and animals no European had ever seen. After the United States bought the Louisiana Territory from France in 1803, President Thomas Jefferson decided to send an expedition to explore it. He chose two brave men: Meriwether Lewis and William Clark.</p><h2>The Expedition Begins</h2>
<p>In May 1804, the Corps of Discovery set off from St. Louis. They traveled up the Missouri River in a large boat and several canoes. Their journey was incredibly difficult: strong currents, dangerous animals like grizzly bears, and harsh weather tested their resolve.</p>

<h2>Key Figures</h2>
<p>One of the most important members was Sacagawea, a young Shoshone woman. She joined the expedition with her baby, guiding them through rough terrain, helping find food, and acting as an interpreter. Her presence also signaled to other tribes that the expedition was peaceful.</p>

<h2>Reaching the Pacific</h2>
<p>After more than a year of travel, they finally reached the Pacific Ocean in November 1805. There, they built a fort, spent the winter, and prepared for the journey home.</p>

<h2>Homeward and Legacy</h2>
<p>They returned to St. Louis in September 1806, having traveled thousands of miles, mapped new territories, and recorded hundreds of new species of plants and animals. Their journey opened the door for westward expansion and helped America understand its newly acquired land.</p>
