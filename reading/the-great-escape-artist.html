  <h1>The Great Escape Artist: Harry Houdini</h1>

  <div class="container">
    <p>Harry Houdini was not just a magician; he was a master escape artist, famous for his incredible ability to free himself from almost any restraint. Born Erik Weisz in Budapest, Hungary, in 1874, his family later immigrated to the United States when he was a young boy. He grew up in poverty, working many jobs to help his family, but his passion for magic began early.</p>
    <p>Houdini started his career as a traditional magician, performing card tricks and illusions. However, he soon realized that his real talent lay in escaping. He began to specialize in freeing himself from handcuffs, ropes, and locked containers. His acts became more daring and sensational. He would challenge police departments to shackle him, only to escape in minutes. He even escaped from a straitjacket while hanging upside down from a crane!</p>
    <p>One of his most famous tricks was the "Chinese Water Torture Cell." Houdini would be submerged headfirst in a locked tank filled with water, his ankles clamped in stocks. The audience would hold their breath, wondering how he could possibly survive. But after a few tense minutes, he would always emerge, dripping wet but triumphant.</p>
    <p>Houdini's success wasn't just about strength or flexibility. It was also about his deep understanding of locks and mechanisms, his incredible patience, and his courage. He spent hours studying how locks worked, often carrying a small set of tools to practice. He also had an unwavering belief in himself.</p>
    <p>Beyond his performances, Houdini was also a crusader against fake spiritualists. In the early 20th century, many people claimed to have supernatural powers, like communicating with the dead. Houdini, a rationalist, spent a significant part of his later life exposing these frauds. He believed they preyed on vulnerable people and took their money. He even offered a reward to anyone who could demonstrate genuine supernatural abilities under scientific conditions, a reward that was never claimed.</p>
    <p>Harry Houdini died in 1926, at the age of 52, from a ruptured appendix. His death was sudden and unexpected. Even today, over 90 years later, he remains one of the most famous and enigmatic figures in the history of magic. His legacy continues to inspire magicians and entertainers worldwide, reminding us of the power of human ingenuity and determination.</p>
