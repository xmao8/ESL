  <h1>The Travel Plans</h1>
  <div class="container">

      <p>Setting: A cozy coffee shop. Three friends are sitting around a small table with coffee cups.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue">
      <p><strong>ANNA:</strong> (Looking at a travel guide, highlighting pages)</p>
      <p><strong>BEN:</strong> (Scrolling on his phone)</p>
      <p><strong>CHLOE:</strong> (Enters carrying a small backpack, looking disheveled but smiling) Hey everyone! So sorry I'm late. My flight landed really early this morning.</p>

      <p><strong>ANNA:</strong> Chloe! You're back! How was your backpacking trip through the national parks? We've been waiting to hear all about it.</p>
      <p><strong>BEN:</strong> Yeah, spill the beans! Did you see any bears?</p>

      <p><strong>CHLOE:</strong> (Puts her backpack down, stretches) It was amazing! Exhausting, but amazing. I hiked for miles, slept in a tent under the stars... and yes, I saw a bear, but from a safe distance!</p>

      <p><strong>ANNA:</strong> (Gasps) Oh, a bear! That's... adventurous! I could never do a backpacking trip. I need my comfy hotel bed, room service, a proper shower. My next trip is to Rome, and I've already booked every tour and dinner reservation.</p>

      <p><strong>BEN:</strong> (Chuckles) Sounds like a military operation, Anna. I'm more like Chloe. I prefer just showing up and seeing what happens. Last year, I bought a train ticket to nowhere and just got off when a town looked interesting.</p>

      <p><strong>CHLOE:</strong> (Smiling) Really, Ben? That's even more spontaneous than me! I had a basic route, but I definitely changed my plans a few times. Like, one day I decided to climb a different peak because someone at the campsite recommended it.</p>

      <p><strong>ANNA:</strong> See, that gives me anxiety just thinking about it! What if there are no rooms available? What if the restaurant is closed? I spend months planning to avoid all "what ifs."</p>

      <p><strong>BEN:</strong> But that's the fun part! The unexpected moments, the challenges. Those are the best travel stories, aren't they? Like the time I got lost in that little village in France and ended up at a local festival. I wouldn't have found it if I'd followed a schedule.</p>

      <p><strong>CHLOE:</strong> He's right, Anna. My tent broke on the second night, and I had to improvise. It was stressful, but now it's a funny story. And I met some incredible people trying to fix it.</p>

      <p><strong>ANNA:</strong> (Sighs) I suppose so. My stories are usually about how perfectly everything went. Which is nice, I guess. So, Chloe, what was your favorite part of the trip?</p>

      <p><strong>CHLOE:</strong> Definitely the sunrises over the mountains. And the silence. No city noise, just nature. It was truly a break from everything. But now I need a real bed and a good cup of coffee!</p>

      <p><strong>BEN:</strong> Well, Chloe, welcome back to civilization! Sounds like you earned some rest. Anna, maybe next time, you can book a <em>little</em> less, and Ben, maybe try booking <em>one</em> thing?</p>

      <p><strong>ANNA:</strong> (Laughs) Maybe. A very small step for mankind!</p>
      <p><strong>BEN:</strong> And a giant leap for Anna!</p>

      <p>(They all laugh, sipping their coffee as the lights fade.)</p>
