    <h1>The Greek Gods — Life on Mount Olympus</h1>

    <main>
        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>The Twelve Olympians</h2>
            <p>In ancient Greek mythology, the most important gods lived high above the earth on a mountain called <strong>Mount Olympus</strong>. These powerful beings were known as the <strong>Twelve Olympians</strong>, and they ruled over different parts of life and nature. Although they behaved like humans—loving, fighting, and making mistakes—they had incredible powers that shaped the world.</p>
            <p>At the top was <strong>Zeus</strong>, the king of the gods. He controlled the sky, thunder, and lightning. His weapon was a mighty <em>thunderbolt</em>, and his symbol was the eagle. Zeus ruled with strength and justice, though he was also known for his temper and romantic adventures.</p>
            <p>Beside him was his wife, <strong>Hera</strong>, the queen of the gods and protector of marriage and family. Hera was proud and powerful, but she was often jealous of Zeus’s many love affairs. Despite her anger, she was respected as a symbol of loyalty and devotion.</p>
            <p><strong>Poseidon</strong>, Zeus’s brother, ruled the sea. With his <em>trident</em>—a three-pronged spear—he could cause storms, waves, and earthquakes. Sailors prayed to him for safe voyages. Another brother, <strong>Hades</strong>, ruled the <em>underworld</em>, where souls went after death. Although Hades was feared, he was not evil; he simply kept balance between life and death.</p>
            <p><strong>Athena</strong>, the goddess of wisdom and strategy, was one of the most admired gods. She was born fully grown from Zeus’s head, wearing armor and holding a shield. Athens, the famous city of Greece, was named in her honor. She represented intelligence, courage, and justice.</p>
            <p><strong>Apollo</strong> and his twin sister <strong>Artemis</strong> were also beloved gods. Apollo was the god of the sun, music, and healing. He was known for his golden lyre and his gift of prophecy. Artemis, the goddess of the moon and hunting, protected wild animals and young women. Together, they symbolized harmony between nature and light.</p>
            <p><strong>Aphrodite</strong>, the goddess of love and beauty, had the power to make gods and humans fall in love. Her son, <strong>Eros</strong> (known in Rome as Cupid), used his arrows to spread love everywhere. Another popular god was <strong>Ares</strong>, the god of war. He was brave but also violent, representing the chaos of battle.</p>
            <p><strong>Hermes</strong>, the messenger god, wore winged sandals and could travel between worlds quickly. He guided souls to the underworld and brought messages for Zeus. Finally, <strong>Dionysus</strong>, the god of wine and joy, brought celebration and creativity to people’s lives. He reminded everyone that laughter and art were as important as power and wisdom.</p>
            <p>The Greek gods were more than characters in old stories—they represented human emotions, dreams, and struggles. Through their myths, ancient people explained natural events, taught moral lessons, and explored the meaning of life. Even today, the names of these gods live on in art, literature, and culture around the world.</p>
