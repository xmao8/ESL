    <h1>Hestia — Goddess of the Hearth and Home</h1>

    <main>
        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>The Peaceful Keeper of the Flame</h2>
            <p>In ancient Greek mythology, <strong>Hestia</strong> was the gentle goddess of the hearth, home, and family. She was one of the twelve Olympian gods but lived quietly, away from the drama and battles of Mount Olympus. To the Greeks, Hestia symbolized warmth, peace, and harmony. Her flame burned in every household and temple, reminding people of love, safety, and community.</p>
            <p>Hestia was the daughter of the Titans <strong>Cronus</strong> and <strong>Rhea</strong>, making her the sister of <strong>Zeus</strong>, <strong>Poseidon</strong>, <strong>Hades</strong>, <strong>Demeter</strong>, and <strong>Hera</strong>. When she was born, Cronus swallowed her—like all his children—because he feared one of them would overthrow him. Later, when Zeus forced Cronus to release them, Hestia became the eldest of the Olympian gods. Despite being the oldest, she was also known as the most peaceful and kind.</p>
            <p>Unlike many gods, Hestia stayed away from conflict and power struggles. She refused to marry, even when <strong>Poseidon</strong> and <strong>Apollo</strong> both asked for her hand. Instead, she took an oath to remain a virgin forever and focus on maintaining peace among gods and humans. Zeus respected her decision and gave her a special place of honor: the hearth of Olympus, where her eternal flame would never go out.</p>
            <p>The hearth, or fireplace, was the center of Greek homes and temples. It provided light, warmth, and a place to cook food and gather together. Families prayed to Hestia before meals and thanked her for their blessings. Every new home began with a flame taken from another hearth, symbolizing connection and continuity. Even in city halls and temples, a sacred fire dedicated to Hestia was always kept burning.</p>
            <p>Although Hestia did not have as many adventures or dramatic stories as other gods, her influence was everywhere. She represented stability, kindness, and care—the quiet strength that holds families and communities together. While <strong>Ares</strong> ruled war and <strong>Athena</strong> guided wisdom, Hestia ruled the simple, daily acts of life: cooking, warmth, and hospitality. In every household, she was honored first and last, as the goddess who brought comfort to all.</p>
            <p>Hestia’s Roman equivalent was <strong>Vesta</strong>, and her worship continued for centuries in the Roman world. The priestesses known as the <strong>Vestal Virgins</strong> tended her sacred fire in Rome, ensuring it never went out. To let the flame die was considered a great dishonor. Through these traditions, Hestia’s peaceful spirit lived on as a symbol of home and hope.</p>
            <p>In a world filled with chaos and conflict, Hestia’s calm presence reminded people of what truly matters—family, friendship, and the warmth of a shared hearth. Her story teaches that even the quietest strength can hold a community together, and that peace, though gentle, is one of the greatest powers of all.</p>
