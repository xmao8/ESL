    <h1>The Indus Valley Civilization</h1>

            <h2>Article for Intermediate ESL Adults</h2>

            <p>The Indus Valley Civilization was one of the world’s earliest and most advanced ancient civilizations. It developed about 4,500 years ago in South Asia, near the Indus River. Today, this area is part of modern India and Pakistan. The civilization is famous for its well-planned cities and advanced urban life.</p>

            <p>People in the Indus Valley depended on farming to survive. The Indus River provided water for crops such as wheat, barley, and cotton. Cotton was especially important because the Indus people were among the first to make cloth from it. Farming supported large populations and allowed cities to grow.</p>

            <p>Two of the most important cities were Harappa and Mohenjo-daro. These cities were carefully planned with straight streets and buildings made of baked brick. Many homes had private wells and bathrooms. The cities also had advanced drainage systems that carried waste away, which was very unusual for ancient times.</p>

            <p>The Indus Valley people were skilled traders. They traded goods such as beads, pottery, and textiles with nearby regions, including Mesopotamia. This trade helped the civilization become wealthy and connected to other cultures. Archaeologists have found seals with symbols, which were probably used in trade and business.</p>

            <p>The Indus Valley people had a writing system, but it has not yet been fully understood. The symbols are short and appear on seals and pottery. Because the writing has not been translated, historians still have many questions about their government, religion, and daily life.</p>

            <p>Unlike some other ancient civilizations, there is little evidence of kings, palaces, or large temples. This suggests that the Indus Valley may have had a more equal society. People may have followed shared rules instead of being controlled by powerful rulers.</p>

            <p>The Indus Valley Civilization slowly declined around 1900 BCE. Possible reasons include climate change, floods, or changes in river paths. Even though it disappeared, its achievements in city planning, sanitation, and trade influenced later cultures in South Asia.</p>
