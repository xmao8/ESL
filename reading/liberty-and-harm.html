    <h1>Liberty and Harm — John Stuart Mill</h1>

    <main>
        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>The Harm Principle</h2>
            <p>
                In 1859, the English philosopher <strong>John Stuart Mill</strong> published a famous book called
                <em>On Liberty</em>. In this book, he asked a very important question: when is it right for society or
                the government to limit a person’s freedom? Mill wanted a clear rule to answer this question.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mill says that people sometimes try to control others “for their own good.” For example, they may think
                that a certain behavior is unhealthy, unwise, or morally wrong. They might want to use laws or strong
                social pressure to stop that behavior. But Mill argues that this is not a good enough reason to take away
                someone’s <strong>liberty</strong>. He believes that adults should be free to make their own choices about
                their lives, even if other people think those choices are foolish.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mill gives a clear rule, which is often called the <strong>harm principle</strong>. He says that the only
                reason to use power against someone—either by law or by strong public pressure—is to prevent
                <strong>harm to others</strong>. A person should not be forced or punished just to make them healthier, or
                happier, or more moral. These can be good reasons to talk to them, advise them, or try to persuade them,
                but not to control them by force.
            </p>
            <p>
                According to Mill, each person is the ruler, or <strong>sovereign</strong>, of his or her own “body and
                mind.” This means that the part of a person’s life that only affects themselves should be free from social
                control. Society may judge or limit a person’s actions only when those actions seriously affect other
                people. He makes an exception for children and people who cannot yet take care of themselves. They need
                more protection, including protection from their own mistakes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mill also worries about the “<strong>tyranny of the majority</strong>.” Even in a democracy, the majority
                can become a kind of ruler that is too strong. The majority’s opinions and customs can push everyone to
                think and act the same way. This social pressure can be as dangerous as a strict king or dictator because
                it kills <strong>individuality</strong> and stops people from living differently.
            </p>
            <p>
                For Mill, real progress in society depends on <strong>freedom of thought</strong> and “experiments in
                living.” People must be allowed to try different ways of life, as long as they do not harm others. This
                diversity helps us discover better ideas and ways of living. When people are free, they can learn from
                both their successes and their mistakes. In this way, liberty is not only good for individuals, but also
                for the improvement of the whole society.
            </p>
