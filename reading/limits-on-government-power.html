    <h1>Limits on Government Power — John Locke</h1>

    <main>
        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Laws, Consent, and the Legislature</h2>
            <p>
                In his <em>Second Treatise of Government</em>, the English philosopher <strong>John Locke</strong> wrote
                about how far government power should go. He believed that people create governments so they can enjoy
                their <strong>property</strong>—their lives, freedoms, and possessions—in <strong>peace and safety</strong>.
                For Locke, the first important step in any <strong>commonwealth</strong> (organized political community)
                is to set up a <strong>legislative power</strong>, the part of government that makes laws.
            </p>
            <p>
                Locke says the legislative power is the “supreme” power in the state, because it decides the rules that
                everyone must follow. However, this power is not unlimited. It only has authority because the people
                have given it their <strong>consent</strong>. No one can have the right to make laws for others unless
                that power comes from the people themselves. When people accept these laws, they give up some of their
                natural freedom, but they do this to gain better protection for their rights.
            </p>
            <p>
                For Locke, law is not just a restriction. He writes that law is a <strong>direction</strong> for a free
                and intelligent person, guiding them toward their true interests. A good law helps people live safely and
                peacefully. Therefore, the legislature cannot rule by sudden, personal decisions or by
                <strong>arbitrary</strong> commands. Instead, it must rule by <strong>standing laws</strong>—stable,
                published rules—and by known, authorized judges who apply those rules fairly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Locke also explains that the legislature cannot rightfully take anyone’s property without that person’s
                consent. The whole purpose of government is to preserve property. If a government could simply take
                property whenever it wanted, people would be worse off than they were in the state of nature. For
                example, <strong>taxes</strong> must be approved by the people, either directly or through their
                <strong>representatives</strong>. When a government taxes people without their consent, it is acting
                against the trust given to it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, Locke reminds us that legislative power is a kind of <strong>trust</strong>. The people trust
                their leaders to use power only for the public good, not for personal gain or absolute control. If the
                legislature tries to destroy people’s property or make itself all-powerful, it breaks this trust. In that
                case, Locke argues, the people have the right to change the government and create a new legislative power
                that will protect their rights. For him, the power of government always depends on the continuing consent
                of the people.
