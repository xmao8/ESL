            <p><span class="character-name">LIAM:</span> Great. I'll get that for you right away. And your sandwich will be out soon too, ma'am.</p>
            <p><span class="character-name">CHLOE:</span> Thank you.</p>
            <p class="scene-direction">(Liam goes to get the bread. Noah looks a little less impatient.)</p>
            <p><span class="character-name">CHLOE:</span> Hopefully, the food will be good.</p>
