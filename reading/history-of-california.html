    <h1>The Golden State: A Brief History of California</h1>

    <article>
        <p>California, often called the "Golden State," is known today for its innovative technology, beautiful beaches, and vibrant culture. But its rich history is as diverse and dynamic as its landscape. Understanding California's past helps us appreciate its unique character and global influence.</p>

        <p>Before European explorers arrived, California was home to hundreds of thousands of **indigenous** people, living in many different tribes and speaking over 100 languages. These Native Americans had complex societies, rich spiritual traditions, and sustainable ways of life, adapting to California's varied environments, from its long coastline to its vast deserts and high mountains.</p>

        <p>The first Europeans to explore California were the Spanish. Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo was the first to sail along its coast in 1542, but permanent Spanish settlement didn't begin until the late 18th century. Starting in 1769, Spain established a chain of 21 **missions** along the coast, from San Diego to Sonoma. These missions, along with military forts called **presidios** and large land grants for cattle ranches known as **ranchos**, aimed to colonize the land and convert Native Americans to Christianity. This **colonial** period brought significant changes and hardships for the indigenous population, including forced labor and disease.</p>

        <p>In 1821, Mexico gained independence from Spain, and California became part of the new Mexican Republic. During this **Mexican Rule** period, the missions were **secularized**, meaning their lands were given to Mexican citizens (Californios) as large ranchos. This era saw an increase in trade and a growing presence of American settlers.</p>

        <p>However, Mexican rule was short-lived. In 1846, the Mexican-American War began, and by 1848, with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, California was **annexed** by the United States. Just days before this treaty was signed, something happened that would forever change California: gold was discovered at Sutter's Mill in January 1848. This discovery triggered the famous **Gold Rush**, attracting hundreds of thousands of **migrants** from around the world who hoped to strike it rich. This massive **boom** in population led to rapid development and, in 1850, California officially became the 31st U.S. state.</p>

        <p>The 20th century was a time of immense growth and **innovation** for California. Agriculture flourished in the Central Valley, making the state a major food producer. The entertainment industry, particularly Hollywood, rose to global prominence. After World War II, the rise of technology and defense industries, especially in what became known as Silicon Valley, transformed the state into a world leader in computers and software. This period also saw significant population growth and increased **diversity**.</p>

        <p>California's history is a story of continuous change, marked by waves of migration, economic transformations, and a constant drive for new ideas. Its ability to adapt and lead in various sectors, from agriculture to technology and culture, reflects its enduring **resilience**. From its ancient indigenous roots to its modern status as a global powerhouse, California has played a **pivotal** role in shaping both American and world history.</p>
