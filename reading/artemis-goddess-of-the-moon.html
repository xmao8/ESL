    <h1>Artemis — Goddess of the Moon and the Hunt</h1>

    <main>
        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>The Protector of Nature and the Young</h2>
            <p>In ancient Greek mythology, <strong>Artemis</strong> was one of the most honored goddesses on Mount Olympus. She was the goddess of the moon, hunting, wild animals, and young women. Independent and strong, Artemis represented freedom and balance between strength and kindness. She was admired for her bravery, her love of nature, and her loyalty to her family.</p>
            <p>Artemis was the daughter of <strong>Zeus</strong>, the king of the gods, and <strong>Leto</strong>, a gentle Titaness. She had a twin brother, <strong>Apollo</strong>, the god of the sun, music, and prophecy. While Apollo brought light to the world during the day, Artemis illuminated the night with her moonlight. The twins shared a deep connection, often working together to protect both gods and humans.</p>
            <p>From a young age, Artemis loved the wilderness. She asked her father for a bow and arrows made of silver so she could roam the forests and hunt animals. However, she was not a cruel hunter. Artemis respected nature and punished anyone who harmed it without reason. She was often seen accompanied by a group of nymphs—young maidens who followed her in her travels through the woods and mountains.</p>
            <p>One of the most famous myths about Artemis is the story of <strong>Actaeon</strong>, a hunter who accidentally saw her bathing in a forest spring. Angry that he had disrespected her privacy, Artemis turned him into a stag, and his own hunting dogs chased him down. The story showed her strict sense of honor and the importance of respecting boundaries, both in nature and in life.</p>
            <p>Artemis was also known as the protector of young women and animals. Many prayed to her for safety during childbirth and for good health. Despite her gentleness, she was a fierce defender of innocence and justice. When someone tried to harm the weak or destroy the balance of nature, Artemis acted swiftly to punish them. She believed that strength should be used to protect, not to control.</p>
            <p>In art and literature, Artemis was often depicted wearing a short tunic for ease of movement, carrying her bow and arrows, with a crescent moon glowing above her head. Deer and hunting dogs were her sacred animals, symbolizing grace and loyalty. Temples dedicated to Artemis stood across Greece, the most famous being the grand <strong>Temple of Artemis at Ephesus</strong>, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.</p>
            <p>To the ancient Greeks, Artemis represented independence, purity, and respect for the natural world. She reminded people that strength and compassion can exist together. Even today, her image continues to inspire stories, art, and culture as a symbol of freedom, equality, and the harmony between humanity and nature.</p>
