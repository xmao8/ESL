  <h1>"But" vs. "However"</h1>
  <div class="container">
    <p>"But" and "however" both serve the purpose of introducing a contrast or an opposing idea. However, they differ significantly in their grammatical function, punctuation, and level of formality.</p>

    <h2>But</h2>
    <p><strong>Grammatical Function:</strong> "But" is a coordinating conjunction. It connects two independent clauses (complete sentences) of equal grammatical importance.</p>
    <p><strong>Punctuation:</strong> When "but" connects two independent clauses, it is usually preceded by a comma.<br>
       <em>Example:</em> I wanted to go to the beach, but it started raining.</p>
    <p><strong>Flexibility:</strong> "But" is typically used in the middle of a sentence. It cannot freely move to different positions within a clause.</p>
    <p><strong>Formality:</strong> "But" is generally more informal and conversational. It creates a smooth, direct connection between ideas.</p>
    <p><strong>Usage:</strong> It's often used for a direct, slight contrast.</p>
    <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>She studied hard, but she still found the test difficult.</li>
      <li>He likes coffee, but he doesn't drink it after noon.</li>
      <li>The food was good, but the service was slow.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>However</h2>
    <p><strong>Grammatical Function:</strong> "However" is a conjunctive adverb. It connects two independent clauses or sentences, showing a contrasting relationship between them. It functions more like a bridge between ideas rather than a direct connector within a single sentence.</p>
    <p><strong>Punctuation:</strong> Punctuation rules for "however" are more flexible and depend on its position:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>At the beginning of a sentence:</strong> It's followed by a comma.<br>
          <em>Example:</em> I wanted to go to the beach. However, it started raining.</li>
      <li><strong>Between two independent clauses (in one sentence):</strong> It's preceded by a semicolon and followed by a comma.<br>
          <em>Example:</em> I wanted to go to the beach; however, it started raining.</li>
      <li><strong>In the middle of a clause:</strong> It's set off by commas on both sides.<br>
          <em>Example:</em> The weather was beautiful. The trip, however, was unexpectedly expensive.</li>
      <li><strong>At the end of a sentence:</strong> It's preceded by a comma.<br>
          <em>Example:</em> It started raining. I went to the beach anyway, however.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Flexibility:</strong> "However" is much more flexible in its placement within a sentence or between sentences.</p>
    <p><strong>Formality:</strong> "However" is generally more formal and is often used in academic, professional, or more sophisticated writing. It creates a stronger pause and emphasizes the contrast more than "but."</p>
    <p><strong>Usage:</strong> It's used for stronger contrasts, to introduce a new perspective, or to transition between more distinct ideas.</p>
    <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>She studied hard. However, she still found the test difficult.</li>
      <li>He likes coffee; however, he prefers tea in the evenings.</li>
      <li>The food was good. The service, however, was quite slow.</li>
    </ul>

      <tr>
        <td><strong>Placement</strong></td>
        <td>Usually mid-sentence, between clauses</td>

        <td><strong>Formality</strong></td>
        <td>More informal, conversational</td>
        <td>More formal, academic</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Emphasis</strong></td>
        <td>Direct, smoother contrast</td>

    <p>Choosing between "but" and "however" depends on the desired tone, the specific grammatical structure, and the emphasis you want to place on the contrasting idea.</p>
