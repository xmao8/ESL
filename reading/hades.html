    <h1>Hades — God of the Underworld</h1>

    <main>
        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>The Silent Ruler of the Dead</h2>
            <p>In ancient Greek mythology, <strong>Hades</strong> was the god of the underworld—the kingdom of the dead. He was one of the three powerful brothers who ruled the universe, along with <strong>Zeus</strong>, the god of the sky, and <strong>Poseidon</strong>, the god of the sea. When they defeated their father, <em>Cronus</em>, they divided the world among themselves: Zeus took the heavens, Poseidon ruled the waters, and Hades received the realm beneath the earth.</p>
            <p>Although many people feared Hades, he was not considered evil. He did not cause death or harm people; instead, he made sure that every soul found its place after life. His role was to maintain balance between life and death. The Greeks respected him, even if they were afraid to speak his name. They often called him “the Unseen One” or “the Wealthy One,” because precious metals like gold and silver came from under the earth—his domain.</p>
            <p>Hades ruled the underworld with strict fairness. His kingdom was divided into several regions: the <strong>Asphodel Fields</strong> for ordinary souls, the <strong>Elysian Fields</strong> for heroes and good people, and <strong>Tartarus</strong> for those who committed terrible crimes. Souls were judged before entering, and Hades made sure that justice was done. The underworld also had a dark river called the <strong>Styx</strong>, which souls had to cross with the help of the boatman <strong>Charon</strong>.</p>
            <p>Hades was known for his seriousness and calm strength. He rarely left his kingdom, but one story tells of the time he fell in love with <strong>Persephone</strong>, the daughter of <strong>Demeter</strong>, the goddess of the harvest. Hades took her to the underworld to be his queen. Demeter was heartbroken, and the earth became cold and barren. Zeus finally ordered Hades to let Persephone return to her mother for part of the year. However, because she had eaten a few seeds of a pomegranate in the underworld, she had to spend the rest of the year with Hades. This myth explained the changing seasons: when Persephone returned to earth, spring came, and when she went back to Hades, winter began.</p>
            <p>Despite his dark surroundings, Hades was not cruel. He ruled with order and intelligence. The Greeks believed that he cared deeply about fairness and the natural cycle of life and death. His presence reminded people that death was not an end, but a part of nature’s balance. He was often shown wearing a dark crown and holding a two-pronged staff called a <strong>bident</strong>, symbolizing his power over the underworld.</p>
            <p>Hades’s character teaches an important lesson: not everything that seems dark is evil. He represented stability, justice, and respect for the laws of nature. Through his story, the ancient Greeks expressed their understanding that life and death are connected, and that both deserve reverence and acceptance.</p>
