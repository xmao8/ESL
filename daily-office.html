  <h1>In the Office ‚Äì The Coffee Conspiracy</h1>

  <div class="container">
    <div class="characters">
      <strong>Characters:</strong><br>
      <strong>ANNA:</strong> (30s) Organized, slightly stressed, always has a to-do list.<br>
      <strong>MARK:</strong> (40s) Laid-back, a bit of a gossip, enjoys his coffee breaks.<br>
      <strong>CHLOE:</strong> (20s) New to the office, eager to please, a little unsure of herself.
    </div>

    <div class="setting note"><strong>Setting:</strong> A small office breakroom. There's a coffee machine, a small table with a few chairs, and a water cooler.</div>

    <div class="dialogue">
      <p class="note">(The scene opens with ANNA frantically searching through a cabinet. MARK enters, whistling, and heads straight for the coffee machine.)</p>

      <p><span class="character">MARK:</span> Morning, Anna! Looks like a tornado hit your corner of the office already?</p>
      <p><span class="character">ANNA:</span> (Without looking up) Morning, Mark. And no, it hasn‚Äôt. I just‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt find the good coffee beans.</p>
      <p><span class="character">MARK:</span> The Columbian Supremo? What do you mean? I saw the bag right here yesterday. Made myself a lovely brew.</p>
      <p><span class="character">ANNA:</span> Exactly! That‚Äôs the problem. It was almost full yesterday. Now‚Ä¶ (She holds up an almost empty bag of a cheaper brand) ‚Ä¶this is all that‚Äôs left.</p>
      <p><span class="character">MARK:</span> Huh. That‚Äôs odd. Maybe someone finished it off this morning?</p>
      <p><span class="character">ANNA:</span> But who? You and I are usually the only ones here this early. And I haven‚Äôt touched it. I was looking forward to a decent cup before I tackle this mountain of reports.</p>

      <p class="note">(CHLOE enters hesitantly, holding a mug.)</p>

      <p><span class="character">CHLOE:</span> Good morning, Anna. Hi, Mark.</p>
      <p><span class="character">ANNA:</span> Morning, Chloe. Did you happen to make coffee this morning?</p>
      <p><span class="character">CHLOE:</span> Yes, I did. I hope that‚Äôs okay. I wasn‚Äôt sure which beans to use, so I just picked the‚Ä¶ the brown bag.</p>
      <p><span class="character">ANNA:</span> (Sighs, holding up the cheap bag) This brown bag?</p>
      <p><span class="character">CHLOE:</span> (Looking flustered) Oh! Um‚Ä¶ yes. Were those the wrong ones? I‚Äôm so sorry. I just wanted to be helpful.</p>
      <p><span class="character">MARK:</span> (Chuckles softly) Well, Chloe, those are‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs just say Anna has a particular fondness for the more‚Ä¶ premium blend.</p>
      <p><span class="character">ANNA:</span> (Massaging her temples) Particular is an understatement, Mark. That coffee is the only thing that gets me through some days. And now it‚Äôs gone.</p>
      <p><span class="character">CHLOE:</span> (Voice trembling slightly) I really am sorry. I didn‚Äôt realize there was a difference. They both looked like coffee beans.</p>
      <p><span class="character">MARK:</span> No worries, newbie. We‚Äôve all been there. Remember that time, Anna, when‚Ä¶ (He trails off as Anna gives him a sharp look.) Never mind.</p>
      <p><span class="character">ANNA:</span> Chloe, it‚Äôs alright. Just‚Ä¶ next time, maybe ask before making a whole pot. The good beans are usually on the top shelf, in the silver bag.</p>
      <p><span class="character">CHLOE:</span> Silver bag, top shelf. Got it. I‚Äôll‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll make sure to use those tomorrow.</p>
      <p><span class="character">ANNA:</span> Thanks, Chloe. (To Mark) So, Mark, you said you made coffee yesterday. How much of the good stuff did you use?</p>
      <p><span class="character">MARK:</span> Just a couple of scoops. Enough for my morning fix. I swear there was still plenty left.</p>
      <p><span class="character">ANNA:</span> (Looking pointedly at the almost empty cheap bag) Right. So, someone used almost the entire rest of it this morning. And Chloe only made one pot.</p>
      <p class="note">(A beat of silence. Chloe looks down at her mug.)</p>
      <p><span class="character">MARK:</span> (Shrugs innocently) Hey, don‚Äôt look at me. I‚Äôm a one-cup wonder.</p>
      <p><span class="character">ANNA:</span> (Her gaze settling on Chloe) Chloe‚Ä¶ are you sure you only made one pot? This looks like a lot of weak, sad coffee.</p>
      <p><span class="character">CHLOE:</span> (Fidgeting with her mug) Well‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶ I might have had a second cup. It was a long commute.</p>
      <p><span class="character">ANNA:</span> (Exasperated) A second cup? Chloe, this bag was practically full yesterday! A couple of scoops for Mark, and then‚Ä¶ almost the entire bag for your ‚Äúlong commute‚Äù?</p>
      <p><span class="character">CHLOE:</span> (Her voice barely a whisper) I‚Ä¶ I really like coffee. And it didn‚Äôt taste very strong.</p>
      <p><span class="character">MARK:</span> (Trying to lighten the mood) Alright, alright, no need for a coffee bean inquisition! Maybe we can all chip in and buy Anna a new bag of her precious beans.</p>
      <p><span class="character">ANNA:</span> (Sighs) It‚Äôs not just about the money, Mark. It‚Äôs the principle! The Columbian Supremo is a sacred office resource!</p>
      <p><span class="character">CHLOE:</span> (Looking genuinely upset) I truly am sorry, Anna. I didn‚Äôt mean to cause any trouble. I can‚Ä¶ I can go out and buy you a new bag right now.</p>
      <p><span class="character">ANNA:</span> (Softening slightly) No, Chloe, it‚Äôs okay. Just‚Ä¶ please be more mindful next time. And maybe stick to one cup of whatever coffee is available when you first get in.</p>
      <p><span class="character">MARK:</span> (Patting Chloe on the shoulder) Live and learn, kiddo. Now, who wants some of this‚Ä¶ (He gestures to the weak coffee) ‚Ä¶watered-down sadness?</p>
      <p class="note">(Anna groans and rubs her eyes. Chloe looks sheepish. The tension in the breakroom lingers, a silent testament to the great office coffee conspiracy.)</p>
