    <h1>Rock Climbing – Reaching New Heights Outdoors</h1>

    <main>
        <!-- Reading Text -->
        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>What Is Rock Climbing?</h2>
            <p>
                Rock climbing is one of the most exciting and physically demanding outdoor adventures. It challenges both
                the body and the mind as climbers work their way up cliffs, boulders, and rock faces using strength,
                balance, and careful planning. Whether climbing a small boulder close to the ground or a tall wall
                hundreds of feet high, rock climbing is a thrilling way to experience nature and push your personal limits.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are several types of rock climbing, and each one offers different challenges. <strong>Bouldering</strong>
                is climbing on short rock formations without ropes, usually no higher than 4–5 meters (about 15 feet).
                Climbers use thick mats, called crash pads, on the ground to help protect them if they fall. Because
                bouldering routes are short and intense, they focus on powerful moves, balance, and problem-solving.
            </p>

            <h2>Climbing with Ropes</h2>
            <p>
                Another common style is <strong>top-rope climbing</strong>, where a rope runs from the climber up through
                an anchor at the top of the wall and back down to a partner called a <strong>belayer</strong>. The belayer
                manages the rope and catches the climber if they slip. This style allows beginners to practice safely
                while learning how to use climbing equipment and how to trust their partner.
            </p>
            <p>
                More advanced climbers often try <strong>lead climbing</strong>. In lead climbing, the climber brings the
                rope up with them and clips it into anchors as they move higher. This requires confidence, good technique,
                and the ability to stay calm. Falls in lead climbing can be longer, so proper training and safety are
                very important.
            </p>

            <h2>A Mental and Physical Challenge</h2>
            <p>
                Rock climbing is not only about strong muscles. It is also a mental challenge. Climbers must look closely
                at the rock to find the best path upward, choosing which holds to use for their hands and feet. This
                process, called <strong>route reading</strong>, requires concentration, patience, and problem-solving
                skills. Many climbers say that climbing feels like moving meditation because they focus completely on the
                present moment. Everyday worries tend to disappear while they plan each move.
            </p>
            <p>
                Physically, climbing strengthens almost every part of the body. Arms, shoulders, back, and core muscles
                do most of the pulling and stabilizing, while legs provide power and balance. Flexibility helps climbers
                stretch to distant holds or move smoothly over difficult sections. Because climbing uses body weight as
                resistance, it builds strength without the need for heavy gym equipment.
            </p>

            <h2>Nature, Community, and Safety</h2>
            <p>
                One of the greatest joys of rock climbing is exploring beautiful outdoor areas. Many climbing spots, called
                <strong>crags</strong>, are in deserts, forests, and mountain valleys. Famous places like Yosemite Valley,
                Red River Gorge, and Smith Rock attract climbers from around the world. Climbing lets people see nature
                from unique angles and enjoy amazing views that can only be reached by going up the rock.
            </p>
            <p>
                Climbing also has a strong sense of community. Climbers encourage each other, share advice, and celebrate
                progress together. Safety is always a key part of the sport. Climbers must learn how to use ropes,
                harnesses, helmets, and carabiners correctly. They also need to check weather conditions, watch for loose
                rock, and protect the environment by staying on established trails and not damaging plants or wildlife.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whether someone climbs to reach the top, to challenge themselves, or simply to enjoy the outdoors, rock
                climbing offers a rewarding and unforgettable experience.
            </p>
