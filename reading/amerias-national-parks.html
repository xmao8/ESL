            <h2>Protecting Special Places</h2>
            <p>
                The United States is home to some of the most beautiful natural areas in the world, and many of them are
                protected as <strong>national parks</strong>. A national park is a special place that the government has
                decided to protect so that everyone—now and in the future—can enjoy it. These parks include mountains,
                canyons, forests, deserts, lakes, and even active volcanoes.
            </p>
            <p>
                National parks are important because they protect plants, animals, and entire <strong>ecosystems</strong>.
                In parks like <strong>Yellowstone</strong>, bison, wolves, elk, and bears live in their natural habitat.
                In <strong>Everglades</strong> National Park, alligators, birds, and fish depend on wetlands and slow-moving
                water. By protecting these places, national parks help keep nature in balance and give scientists a chance
                to study environments that are not heavily changed by human activity.
            </p>

            <h2>Geological Wonders</h2>
            <p>
                National parks also protect amazing <strong>geological</strong> features—landforms created over millions
                of years. The <strong>Grand Canyon</strong> in Arizona is one of the most famous examples. Its deep cliffs
                and colorful rock layers show how the Colorado River slowly carved through the rock. In
                <strong>Hawaii Volcanoes</strong> National Park, visitors can see lava flows and learn how islands are
                formed. Parks like <strong>Arches</strong> and <strong>Bryce Canyon</strong> in Utah are filled with
                strange and beautiful rock shapes made by wind, water, and time.
            </p>

            <h2>Adventure and Recreation</h2>
            <p>
                People visit national parks for many reasons, but one of the biggest is adventure. Visitors can hike,
                camp, kayak, climb, or simply enjoy a scenic drive. Some hikes are short and easy, while others are long
                and challenging. Watching the sunrise over the mountains in <strong>Yosemite</strong> or looking up at the
                stars in <strong>Joshua Tree</strong> can be experiences that people remember for the rest of their lives.
            </p>

            <h2>History and Culture</h2>
            <p>
                National parks do not only protect nature; they also protect human history and culture. At
                <strong>Mesa Verde</strong> in Colorado, visitors can see ancient cliff dwellings built by the Ancestral
                Pueblo people more than 700 years ago. In <strong>Great Smoky Mountains</strong> National Park, old
                houses, barns, and churches show how early settlers lived. These parks help us learn about the people
                who lived on this land long before we did.
            </p>

            <h2>The Role of Visitors</h2>
            <p>
                The <strong>National Park Service</strong>, created in 1916, takes care of these places. Their goal is to
                protect the parks and also help visitors enjoy them. However, visitors must also do their part. Staying
                on marked trails, not feeding wildlife, and taking all trash out of the park are simple ways to help.
                When everyone is careful and respectful, national parks can stay healthy and beautiful for future
                generations.
            </p>
