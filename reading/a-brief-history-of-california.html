    <h1>A Brief History of California</h1>

    <main>
        <!-- Reading Text -->
        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>From Native Lands to Spanish Missions</h2>
            <p>
                California is one of the most diverse and influential states in the United States, but its history began
                long before it became part of the country. For thousands of years, many Native American tribes lived
                across the region. These groups, such as the Chumash, Miwok, and Pomo peoples, built villages, traded
                goods, fished along the coast, and developed rich cultures. They lived close to the land and used natural
                resources to survive.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the 1500s, European explorers first reached the California coast. Spanish explorers claimed the land
                and later began to settle the area. In the late 1700s, Spain built a series of <strong>missions</strong>—
                religious and farming communities—along the coast from San Diego to Sonoma. The missions were created to
                convert Native Americans to Christianity and to teach them European ways of farming and building. Many
                Native Americans were forced to live and work at the missions, and their traditional cultures were
                deeply changed.
            </p>

            <h2>Mexican California and the Ranchos</h2>
            <p>
                In 1821, Mexico gained independence from Spain, and California became part of Mexico. During this time,
                large cattle ranches called <strong>ranchos</strong> became important. Mexican landowners raised cattle
                for meat and leather, and the ranchos shaped California’s economy and lifestyle. Trade with the United
                States and other countries increased, and more outsiders began to travel to California.
            </p>

            <h2>The Gold Rush and Statehood</h2>
            <p>
                Everything changed in 1848 when gold was discovered at Sutter’s Mill near Sacramento. News spread quickly,
                and thousands of people from all over the world rushed to California in what became known as the
                <strong>Gold Rush</strong>. These newcomers, called “forty-niners,” came hoping to get rich. Towns grew
                rapidly, businesses opened, and California’s population exploded almost overnight. The Gold Rush also
                brought people from China, South America, and Europe, adding to the cultural diversity that remains today.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because of its fast-growing population and economic importance, California became the 31st state of the
                United States in 1850. After statehood, agriculture became a major industry. Farmers used California’s
                rich soil and sunny climate to grow fruits, vegetables, and grapes. The completion of the transcontinental
                railroad in 1869 connected California to the rest of the country, making travel and trade much easier.
            </p>

            <h2>Modern California</h2>
            <p>
                In the 20th century, California continued to grow and change. Hollywood became the center of the movie
                industry, attracting actors, writers, and directors from around the world. Later, Silicon Valley in
                Northern California became the heart of the technology boom, home to many major companies and start-ups.
                California also became known for aerospace research, universities, and environmental movements.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, California is famous for its cultural diversity, innovation, and natural beauty. From beaches and
                deserts to mountains and forests, the state offers many different landscapes. People from all over the
                world have contributed to California’s history, making it a place where many languages, foods, and
                traditions come together.
            </p>
            <p>
                California’s history is a story of change—new people arriving, new ideas growing, and new industries
                developing. Its past has shaped its identity as a state full of creativity, opportunity, and cultural
                richness.
