    <h1>The Fourth Amendment — Protecting Privacy and Freedom</h1>

    <main>
        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Your Right to Be Secure</h2>
            <p>The <strong>Fourth Amendment</strong> to the United States Constitution protects people from unfair searches and seizures by the government. It is one of the key parts of the <strong>Bill of Rights</strong>, which was added in 1791 to protect individual freedoms. The Fourth Amendment ensures that Americans have a right to privacy in their homes, belongings, and personal information. It reminds citizens that the government must respect personal space and freedom unless it has a good reason backed by law.</p>
            <p>The amendment says: “The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause.” This means that police officers and government agents cannot search someone’s home, car, or belongings without a valid reason. They usually need a <strong>warrant</strong>, which is a written order from a judge giving permission for the search.</p>
            <p>For a warrant to be granted, there must be <strong>probable cause</strong>—clear evidence that a crime has been committed or that evidence of a crime will be found in the place to be searched. This rule balances two important goals: protecting public safety and defending personal liberty. It prevents authorities from using power unfairly while still allowing them to enforce the law when necessary.</p>
            <p>However, there are some exceptions to the warrant requirement. For example, if police see something illegal in plain sight, they may act immediately. If there is an emergency, such as a person in danger or evidence being destroyed, police may also act without waiting for a warrant. The courts often decide whether such searches were “reasonable” by examining the specific situation.</p>
            <p>Over time, the Fourth Amendment has evolved with technology. Today, it not only covers homes and physical objects but also electronic communication and digital data. Courts have ruled that the government needs warrants to access cell phone records, emails, and other private information. These decisions show how the principles of privacy and fairness continue to apply in the modern world.</p>
            <p>The Fourth Amendment plays a vital role in maintaining trust between citizens and the government. It ensures that no one can be treated as guilty without proof and that personal lives are protected from unnecessary interference. It reminds both the government and the people that freedom requires boundaries—where the law protects the innocent and limits power. In a democracy, this balance between security and privacy is one of the strongest protections of liberty.</p>
