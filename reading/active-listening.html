  <h1>The Power of Active Listening</h1>

  <div class="container">
    <p>Communication is very important in our lives, whether we are at home, at school, or at work. But communication is not just about talking. It is also about listening. Not all listening is the same. There is a special kind of listening called <strong>active listening</strong>.</p>
    
    <h2>What is Active Listening?</h2>
    <p>Active listening means you really focus on what another person is saying. It means you try to understand their message completely, not just the words, but also their feelings and ideas. When you listen actively, you show the speaker that you care about what they are saying.</p>

    <h2>Why is Active Listening Important?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>You understand better:</strong> When you truly listen, you get all the information. You don't miss important details. This helps you do your job well or solve problems correctly.</li>
      <li><strong>People feel respected:</strong> When someone listens actively to you, you feel that your thoughts are important. This builds trust and strong relationships.</li>
      <li><strong>It avoids misunderstandings:</strong> Sometimes, we think we understand, but we don't. Active listening helps to clarify things immediately. This means fewer mistakes and less wasted time.</li>
      <li><strong>It helps solve problems:</strong> If you fully understand a problem from another person's point of view, it is easier to find a good solution together.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Practice Active Listening</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Make eye contact:</strong> Look at the person who is speaking. This shows you are paying attention.</li>
      <li><strong>Don't interrupt:</strong> Let the person finish speaking before you say anything. Be patient.</li>
      <li><strong>Show you are listening:</strong> Nod your head, use small sounds like "Mm-hmm" or "I see." Your body language can show interest.</li>
      <li><strong>Ask clarifying questions:</strong> If you don't understand something, ask a question to get more information. For example, "Could you explain that part again?" or "Do you mean‚Ä¶?"</li>
      <li><strong>Summarize what you heard:</strong> After the person finishes, you can say, "So, if I understand correctly, you mean‚Ä¶" This helps you check your understanding and shows the speaker you were listening.</li>
    </ul>
