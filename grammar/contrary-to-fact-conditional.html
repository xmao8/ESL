  <h1>Contrary to Fact Conditionals</h1>
  <div class="container">
    <p>A <strong>"contrary to fact conditional statement"</strong> is a type of conditional sentence (an "if...then..." statement) where the <strong>"if" clause describes a situation that is known to be untrue or impossible in reality.</strong> Because the "if" condition is not true, the "then" result is also unreal or hypothetical.</p>
    <p>These are also often called <strong>"unreal conditionals"</strong> or <strong>"hypothetical conditionals."</p>

    <h2>Main Idea</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>It‚Äôs about something that <em>isn‚Äôt</em> true or <em>didn't</em> happen.</strong></li>
      <li>It explores what <strong>would</strong> happen, <strong>would have</strong> happened, or <strong>would be</strong> happening if reality were different.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Two Main Types</h2>
    <h3>1. Present/Future Contrary to Fact (Type 2 Conditional)</h3>
    <p>Refers to a situation that is untrue <strong>now</strong> or an unlikely possibility in the <strong>future</strong>.</p>
    <p><strong>Structure:</strong> <code>If + Simple Past Tense</code>, <code>would/could/might + base form of verb</code></p>
    <p><strong>Meaning:</strong> The "if" part is not true in the present or future.</p>
    <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>"If I <strong>were</strong> rich, I <strong>would travel</strong> the world."<br><em>(Meaning: I am NOT rich, so I am NOT traveling the world.)</em></li>
      <li>"If she <strong>knew</strong> the answer, she <strong>would tell</strong> us."<br><em>(Meaning: She does NOT know the answer, so she is NOT telling us.)</em></li>
    </ul>
    <p class="important">Note: For the verb "to be" in the "if" clause of present/future contrary to fact conditionals, we usually use <strong>"were"</strong> for all subjects (even singular ones like "I," "he," "she," "it"). While "was" is sometimes used informally, "were" is grammatically preferred. (e.g., "If I <em>were</em> you...")</p>

    <h3>2. Past Contrary to Fact (Type 3 Conditional)</h3>
    <p>Refers to a situation that <strong>did not happen</strong> in the <strong>past</strong>. It expresses regret or a missed opportunity.</p>
    <p><strong>Structure:</strong> <code>If + Past Perfect Tense</code>, <code>would have/could have/might have + past participle</code></p>
    <p><strong>Meaning:</strong> The "if" part did not happen in the past.</p>
    <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>"If you <strong>had studied</strong> harder, you <strong>would have passed</strong> the exam."<br><em>(Meaning: You did NOT study harder, so you did NOT pass the exam.)</em></li>
      <li>"If it <strong>hadn't rained</strong> yesterday, we <strong>could have gone</strong> to the beach."<br><em>(Meaning: It DID rain yesterday, so we could NOT go to the beach.)</em></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Characteristic</h2>
    <p>In both types, the key characteristic is that the <strong>"if" clause describes a situation that goes against the actual facts or reality.</strong></p>
