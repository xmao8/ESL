            <p>Rosa Parks is one of the most famous leaders of the American Civil Rights Movement. Many people call her “the mother of the Civil Rights Movement” because her simple action on a bus helped start a major fight for equality. Rosa Parks did not become famous because she wanted attention. She became famous because she showed courage during a time when African Americans were treated unfairly by law.</p>

            <p>Rosa Parks was born in 1913 in Alabama, in the southern United States. At that time, segregation was common and legal in many states. Segregation meant that Black and white people had to use different schools, restaurants, bathrooms, and buses. On buses in Montgomery, Alabama, Black passengers had to sit in the back. If the bus became crowded, Black passengers were expected to give their seats to white passengers. This rule was humiliating and unfair.</p>

            <p>On December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks was riding the bus home after work. She was sitting in the “colored section,” which was still not equal, but it was allowed under the law. When the bus filled up, the bus driver told Rosa Parks and other Black passengers to stand so that white passengers could sit. The others stood up, but Rosa Parks stayed seated. She was arrested and taken to jail.</p>

            <p>Some people think Rosa Parks was simply tired that day. She was tired—but not only physically. She was tired of unfair laws and disrespect. Rosa Parks had already been involved in civil rights work for years. She worked with the NAACP, an organization that fought for equal rights. Her decision to stay seated was not an accident. It was a brave and powerful act.</p>

            <p>After her arrest, civil rights leaders organized the Montgomery Bus Boycott. Black citizens refused to ride the buses. Instead, many people walked, carpooled, or found other ways to travel. The boycott lasted 381 days—more than a year. It was difficult, but the community stayed united. During this time, a young pastor named Martin Luther King Jr. became a major leader. The boycott ended when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that bus segregation was illegal.</p>

            <p>Rosa Parks faced serious consequences. She lost her job and received threats. Later, she moved to Detroit, Michigan, to find a safer life and better opportunities. Even after that, she continued to speak and work for civil rights, not only for Black Americans, but for fairness and justice in general.</p>

            <p>Rosa Parks’s story teaches an important lesson: a single brave action can change history. She did not use violence, and she did not shout. She simply said “no” to an unfair rule. Her courage helped inspire a movement that changed laws and opened doors for future generations. Today, Rosa Parks is remembered as a symbol of dignity, strength, and peaceful resistance.</p>
