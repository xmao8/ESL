    <h1>Prometheus — The Fire-Bringer</h1>

    <main>
        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>The Myth of Prometheus</h2>
            <p>In ancient Greek mythology, <strong>Prometheus</strong> was a clever and brave <em>Titan</em>, one of the powerful beings who lived before the gods ruled the world. His name means “forethought,” or the ability to think ahead. Prometheus is famous for one great act—giving <strong>fire</strong> to humans, even though it was forbidden by the chief god, <strong>Zeus</strong>.</p>
            <p>According to the myth, the world was new, and humans were weak and cold. They did not have fire, so they could not cook food, make tools, or stay warm. Prometheus loved humans and wanted to help them survive. He secretly went to <em>Mount Olympus</em>, the home of the gods, and stole fire from the sun or from Zeus’s lightning. Then he carried it down to earth in a hollow stick and gave it to humankind.</p>
            <p>When humans received fire, they became stronger and wiser. They could build houses, make weapons, and protect themselves. Civilization began. However, Zeus was furious. He believed that fire should belong only to the gods, not to humans. To punish Prometheus, Zeus ordered his servants to chain him to a rock in the mountains. Every day, an <strong>eagle</strong> came to eat Prometheus’s <strong>liver</strong>, which grew back each night so that the pain would never end. It was an endless punishment for his disobedience.</p>
            <p>Despite his suffering, Prometheus never regretted helping humans. He became a symbol of <strong>courage</strong>, <strong>rebellion</strong>, and <strong>sacrifice</strong>. In some versions of the story, the hero <em>Heracles (Hercules)</em> eventually freed Prometheus by breaking his chains. This act showed that even the greatest punishments can be overcome by bravery and friendship.</p>
            <p>The story of Prometheus is full of meaning. The fire he gave to humans represents more than just warmth or light—it symbolizes <strong>knowledge</strong>, <strong>creativity</strong>, and <strong>progress</strong>. By bringing fire to the human world, Prometheus gave people the power to think, create, and guide their own destiny. In this way, he is seen as a champion of human freedom.</p>
            <p>At the same time, the myth is also a warning. It shows the conflict between gods and humans, and the danger of defying authority. Zeus’s punishment reminds us that every gift or discovery comes with responsibility. Even today, when humans use science or technology, people sometimes compare it to “stealing fire,” meaning that we must use our power wisely.</p>
            <p>The legend of Prometheus continues to inspire writers, artists, and thinkers. Many modern stories use his name to describe people who challenge unfair systems or bring new ideas to the world. He is often called “the fire-bringer” or “the light-bearer,” a hero who suffered for the sake of humanity. Prometheus’s myth teaches us that progress often requires courage—and that those who bring light to others may have to face darkness themselves.</p>
