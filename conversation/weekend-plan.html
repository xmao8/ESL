  <h1>Weekend Plans</h1>

  <div class="container">
    <p class="scene-info">
      Setting: Friday afternoon at a caf√© near their workplace. Lena, Carlos, and Maya are sitting around a table with coffee.
    </p>
    <div class="dialogue">
      <p><strong>Carlos:</strong> So, what‚Äôs everyone doing this weekend? I need some good ideas!</p>
      <p><strong>Maya:</strong> Hmm, I‚Äôm going to a pottery class on Saturday. It‚Äôs my third time. I love it!</p>
      <p><strong>Lena:</strong> That sounds nice, but messy. I think I‚Äôll just stay home and read. I‚Äôve had a long week.</p>
      <p><strong>Carlos:</strong> Read? Come on, Lena, it‚Äôs the weekend! Let‚Äôs do something exciting‚Äîhiking, maybe?</p>
      <p><strong>Lena:</strong> (Laughs) Hiking? That sounds like more work! I want to relax. My legs are still tired from last weekend‚Äôs shopping trip.</p>
      <p><strong>Maya:</strong> I agree with both of you. Pottery helps me relax <em>and</em> be active. You shape the clay, and it feels so calming.</p>
      <p><strong>Carlos:</strong> Sounds artsy! But I like moving. I was thinking of biking or going to the lake.</p>
      <p><strong>Lena:</strong> Maybe I‚Äôll try pottery someday. But not this weekend. I need my sofa, my tea, and my book.</p>
      <p><strong>Maya:</strong> What about Sunday? Maybe we can do something together‚Äîjust for a few hours?</p>
      <p><strong>Carlos:</strong> Oh! How about we go to the park? We can have a little picnic, maybe play frisbee or volleyball?</p>
      <p><strong>Lena:</strong> That‚Äôs not a bad idea. I could bring some sandwiches. But no running, okay?</p>
      <p><strong>Maya:</strong> Deal! I‚Äôll bring fruit and drinks. And Carlos brings the games.</p>
      <p><strong>Carlos:</strong> Perfect! I‚Äôll bring my speaker too‚Äîsome music will make it more fun! Maybe even some salsa!</p>
      <p><strong>Lena:</strong> (Smiling) I guess I‚Äôm not staying home all weekend after all.</p>
      <p><strong>Maya:</strong> We all need a little fun and fresh air. It‚Äôs good for the brain!</p>
      <p><strong>Carlos:</strong> And the heart! What time works best for everyone?</p>
      <p><strong>Lena:</strong> Hmm... How about 11 in the morning?</p>
      <p><strong>Maya:</strong> Sounds good to me. Riverside Park?</p>
      <p><strong>Carlos:</strong> Yes! Sunday at 11 it is!</p>
      <p><strong>Lena and Maya:</strong> (Yay!) Agreed!</p>
      <p><strong>Carlos:</strong> This will be the best weekend ever!</p>
      <p>(They all smile and clink their coffee cups together.)</p>
