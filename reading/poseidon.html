    <h1>Poseidon — God of the Sea</h1>

    <main>
        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>The Powerful Ruler of the Oceans</h2>
            <p>In ancient Greek mythology, <strong>Poseidon</strong> was one of the most powerful gods. He was the god of the sea, earthquakes, and horses. As one of the three brothers who ruled the world, he shared power with <strong>Zeus</strong>, the god of the sky, and <strong>Hades</strong>, the god of the underworld. After defeating the Titans, the three brothers divided the universe: Zeus ruled the heavens, Poseidon ruled the seas, and Hades ruled the world of the dead.</p>
            <p>Poseidon lived deep under the ocean in a magnificent palace made of coral and precious stones. From there, he controlled all the waters on earth—the oceans, rivers, and even small lakes. Sailors prayed to him for calm seas and safe journeys, but when he was angry, he could create violent storms, whirlpools, and giant waves. His weapon, the <strong>trident</strong>, was a three-pronged spear that could shake the earth and stir the sea into chaos.</p>
            <p>Although Poseidon was a god of great power, he was also known for his changing moods. Just like the sea, he could be peaceful and generous one moment, and furious the next. When people honored him with respect and offerings, he blessed them with good fishing, rain, and fertile land. But if they offended him, he could flood their cities or cause earthquakes, which the Greeks believed were signs of his anger.</p>
            <p>Poseidon had many adventures and was involved in countless myths. One of the most famous is his rivalry with <strong>Athena</strong>, the goddess of wisdom. Both gods wanted to be the patron of a new city in Greece. To win the people’s favor, they each offered a gift: Poseidon struck the ground with his trident and created a saltwater spring, while Athena gave the people an olive tree, a symbol of peace and prosperity. The people chose Athena’s gift, and the city was named <strong>Athens</strong> in her honor. Poseidon, though disappointed, continued to be respected as the protector of sailors and travelers.</p>
            <p>Another legend tells of Poseidon’s creation of the first horse. He was said to have struck the earth with his trident, and out sprang a beautiful horse that ran like the wind. Because of this, Poseidon was also worshiped as the god of horses, and many horse races and festivals were held in his name.</p>
            <p>Poseidon’s personality combined strength, pride, and unpredictability. He represented both the beauty and the danger of the sea—calm and inviting at times, but wild and destructive at others. To the ancient Greeks, he symbolized nature’s power and reminded them of how small humans are compared to the forces of the world. Even today, his name is remembered as a symbol of strength, mystery, and the endless energy of the ocean.</p>
