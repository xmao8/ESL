    <h1>The Fifth Amendment — Rights of the Accused</h1>

    <main>
        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Protection, Fairness, and Justice</h2>
            <p>The <strong>Fifth Amendment</strong> to the United States Constitution is one of the most well-known parts of the <strong>Bill of Rights</strong>. It protects individuals who are accused of crimes and ensures fairness in the legal system. The Fifth Amendment provides several important rights, including protection against <strong>self-incrimination</strong>, <strong>double jeopardy</strong>, and unfair government actions. It guarantees that no one can lose their life, liberty, or property without <strong>due process of law</strong>.</p>
            <p>The first major protection is the right against <strong>self-incrimination</strong>. This means that people cannot be forced to testify or say something that could be used against them in court. You may have heard the phrase, “I plead the Fifth.” This expression comes from the Fifth Amendment and is used when someone chooses to remain silent rather than answer a question that could make them appear guilty. This right helps prevent the government from pressuring people into confessing crimes they did not commit.</p>
            <p>The second protection is the rule against <strong>double jeopardy</strong>. This means that a person cannot be tried twice for the same crime once they have been found innocent or guilty. For example, if someone is found not guilty in court, the government cannot charge them again for that same crime. This protects citizens from being harassed or unfairly punished by repeated trials.</p>
            <p>The Fifth Amendment also ensures the right to <strong>due process</strong>. This phrase means that the government must follow fair and legal procedures before taking away someone’s freedom or property. It requires that people receive notice of the charges against them, a fair hearing, and an opportunity to defend themselves. Due process ensures that justice is applied equally to everyone, regardless of status or wealth.</p>
            <p>Another part of the Fifth Amendment is the <strong>Takings Clause</strong>, which says that private property cannot be taken for public use without fair payment, also known as <strong>just compensation</strong>. This rule balances the needs of the government with the rights of individuals. For instance, if the government wants to build a highway on private land, it must pay the owner a fair price.</p>
            <p>These protections have shaped American law and are essential to maintaining justice and liberty. They ensure that the government cannot misuse its power against individuals. The Fifth Amendment’s principles appear in many famous legal cases and continue to influence modern debates about privacy, fairness, and police conduct.</p>
            <p>In short, the Fifth Amendment stands as a shield for every person living in the United States. It reminds us that fairness and justice are not just ideals—they are rights. By protecting the accused and limiting government power, it upholds the belief that everyone deserves respect and equality under the law.</p>
