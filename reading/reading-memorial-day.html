  <h1>Remembering Heroes on Memorial Day</h1>

  <div class="container">
    <p>Memorial Day is a special holiday in the United States. It happens on the last Monday of May. On this day, Americans remember and honor the people who died while serving in the country's armed forces. It's a time to think about their sacrifice and show our gratitude.</p>

    <p>Many people visit cemeteries and memorials on Memorial Day. They might place flowers or flags on the graves of fallen soldiers. There are also parades in many towns and cities, often featuring veterans, marching bands, and community groups. Some people attend memorial services to remember those who gave their lives for their country.</p>

    <p>It's important to understand that Memorial Day is different from Veterans Day, which is in November. Veterans Day honors all people who have served in the military, whether they are living or deceased. Memorial Day specifically remembers those who died in service.</p>

    <p>For many families, Memorial Day is also a time for gatherings and the unofficial start of summer. People often have picnics, barbecues, and enjoy the long weekend. However, the original and most important meaning of the day is to remember and pay tribute to the brave men and women who died protecting the freedoms of the United States.</p>
