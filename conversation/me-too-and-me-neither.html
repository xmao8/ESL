  <h1>Travel Preferences: Me too or Me Neither</h1>

    <div class="dialogue">
      <p><strong>LUCY:</strong> Oh, wow, look at this picture of the Grand Canyon! It's absolutely stunning. I really want to go there someday.</p>
      <p><strong>MARCUS:</strong> Me too! I've always dreamed of seeing it in person. The scale of it just looks incredible.</p>
      <p><strong>LUCY:</strong> I also love the idea of exploring big cities. Paris, Tokyo, New York... I can't decide which one to visit next.</p>
      <p><strong>MARCUS:</strong> Me neither. They all have so much to offer! But honestly, I'm not a huge fan of crowded tourist spots.</p>
      <p><strong>LUCY:</strong> Me neither, actually. Sometimes the crowds really take away from the experience. I prefer finding the quieter, local spots.</p>
      <p><strong>MARCUS:</strong> Exactly! And I don't really enjoy long flights. They just exhaust me.</p>
      <p><strong>LUCY:</strong> Me neither. Eight hours in a tiny seat? No, thank you! I much prefer road trips.</p>
      <p><strong>MARCUS:</strong> Me too! There's something great about the freedom of the open road. You can stop whenever you want.</p>
      <p><strong>LUCY:</strong> Totally. And I'm not a very good planner, so I don't usually book everything in advance.</p>
      <p><strong>MARCUS:</strong> Me neither. I like to be spontaneous and see where the trip takes me. It makes for better stories!</p>
      <p><strong>LUCY:</strong> Definitely! I haven't done much international travel lately, though.</p>
      <p><strong>MARCUS:</strong> Me neither. I've mostly been exploring different parts of our own country. There's so much to see here!</p>
      <p><strong>LUCY:</strong> Me too! I just got back from a trip to Florida, and it was amazing.</p>
      <p><strong>MARCUS:</strong> Oh, really? I've never been. What was your favorite part?</p>
