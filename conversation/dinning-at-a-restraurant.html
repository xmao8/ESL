    <p><strong>Customer 1:</strong> Good evening. No reservation, but we hope there‚Äôs a table for two.</p>
    <p><strong>Waiter:</strong> Certainly. Please follow me. Here‚Äôs your table. Can I start you off with something to drink?</p>
    <p><strong>Customer 2:</strong> I‚Äôd like a glass of red wine, please.</p>
    <p><strong>Customer 1:</strong> And I‚Äôll have sparkling water, thank you.</p>
    <p><strong>Waiter:</strong> Excellent choices. I‚Äôll be back in a moment with your drinks, and here are the menus.</p>
    <p>(The waiter leaves. The customers open their menus.)</p>
    <p><strong>Customer 1:</strong> Everything looks good. Do you know what you want?</p>
    <p><strong>Customer 2:</strong> I‚Äôm thinking about the risotto. It sounds delicious. What about you?</p>
    <p><strong>Customer 1:</strong> I might try the grilled chicken with vegetables. It sounds healthy.</p>
    <p><strong>Customer 2:</strong> Great. Oh, here comes our waiter.</p>
    <p><strong>Waiter:</strong> Here are your drinks. Are you ready to order, or do you need a couple more minutes?</p>
    <p><strong>Customer 1:</strong> We‚Äôre ready. I‚Äôll have the grilled chicken with seasonal vegetables.</p>
    <p><strong>Customer 2:</strong> And I‚Äôll have the mushroom risotto, please.</p>
    <p><strong>Waiter:</strong> Wonderful. Would you like any side salad or bread with that?</p>
    <p><strong>Customer 1:</strong> A side salad would be great, thank you.</p>
    <p><strong>Waiter:</strong> Perfect. Anything else I can get for you right now?</p>
    <p><strong>Customer 2:</strong> No, that‚Äôs all‚Äîfor now.</p>
    <p><strong>Waiter:</strong> Very good. I‚Äôll get that in right away. Enjoy your evening!</p>

    <p><strong>Customer 1:</strong> It was delicious, thank you.</p>
    <p><strong>Customer 2:</strong> Yes, it was perfect.</p>

    <p><strong>Customer 1:</strong> Just the check, please.</p>
    <p><strong>Waiter:</strong> Of course. I‚Äôll bring it right away.</p>
    <p>(The waiter returns with the check.)</p>
    <p><strong>Waiter:</strong> Here is your check.</p>
    <p><strong>Customer 2:</strong> Thank you.</p>
    <p><strong>Customer 1:</strong> We‚Äôll pay by card.</p>
