    <h1>Zeus — King of the Gods</h1>

    <main>
        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>The Mighty Ruler of Mount Olympus</h2>
            <p>In ancient Greek mythology, <strong>Zeus</strong> was the king of the gods and ruler of Mount Olympus. He was the god of the sky, thunder, and justice. Powerful and wise, Zeus maintained order among gods and humans. To the ancient Greeks, he was the symbol of authority and balance, representing both strength and fairness in the universe.</p>
            <p>Zeus was the youngest son of the Titans <strong>Cronus</strong> and <strong>Rhea</strong>. Cronus had been warned that one of his children would overthrow him, so he swallowed each baby as soon as it was born. When Rhea gave birth to Zeus, she hid him in a cave on the island of Crete and gave Cronus a stone wrapped in cloth instead. Zeus grew up in secret, protected by nymphs and cared for by a magical goat named <strong>Amalthea</strong>. When he became strong enough, Zeus returned to challenge his father. With the help of his brothers and sisters, he defeated Cronus and freed his swallowed siblings—<strong>Poseidon</strong>, <strong>Hades</strong>, <strong>Hera</strong>, <strong>Demeter</strong>, and <strong>Hestia</strong>.</p>
            <p>After the victory, the siblings divided the world among themselves. Zeus took control of the sky and became the supreme ruler of gods and humans. Poseidon ruled the seas, and Hades governed the underworld. Zeus sat on a golden throne at the top of Mount Olympus, where he led the other gods. He was known for his thunderbolt, a weapon of lightning that he used to punish wrongdoers and maintain justice.</p>
            <p>Although Zeus was powerful and respected, he was also known for his complex personality. He valued justice and hospitality, but he could be strict with those who broke divine laws. He punished liars, oath-breakers, and those who showed arrogance toward the gods. At the same time, he was famous for his many love affairs with both goddesses and mortal women. These relationships often caused jealousy and conflict, especially with his wife, <strong>Hera</strong>, the goddess of marriage.</p>
            <p>Zeus played a major role in many myths. He led the gods in the <strong>War against the Titans</strong>, helped heroes like <strong>Perseus</strong> and <strong>Heracles</strong>, and watched over the world from his high throne. In one story, when humans became too proud, Zeus sent a great flood to punish them, saving only a few who were humble and wise. This story showed that Zeus was both a protector and a judge, always seeking balance between mercy and punishment.</p>
            <p>The ancient Greeks honored Zeus with temples, festivals, and sacrifices. The most famous of these was the <strong>Olympic Games</strong>, held every four years in his name. Athletes competed to show strength and skill as an offering to the king of the gods. Even today, the Olympic spirit continues to represent unity, excellence, and respect—values connected to Zeus’s rule.</p>
            <p>Zeus remains one of the most recognized figures in mythology. His image—holding a lightning bolt and seated on a throne—represents power controlled by wisdom. Through his stories, the Greeks taught that true leadership requires fairness, courage, and responsibility. As the ruler of gods and men, Zeus embodied the eternal struggle to balance justice with compassion.</p>
