  <h1>Talking About Past Events</h1>

  <div class="container">
    <p>When we discuss events that happened before now, we choose tenses and structures based on <em>when</em> the action occurred, whether it’s complete or in progress, and its connection to other events or the present.</p>

    <h2>1. The Simple Past Tense</h2>
    <p>Use for completed actions at a specific time (stated or implied).</p>
    <div class="example">
      “I went to the park <strong>yesterday</strong>.” (Specific time)<br>
      “She lived in London for five years.” (Implied completed period)<br>
      “They finished the project last week.” (Specific time)
    </div>

    <h2>2. The Past Continuous Tense</h2>
    <p>Use for actions in progress at a specific past moment or overlapping actions.</p>
    <div class="example">
      “I was watching TV when you called.” (Interrupted action)<br>
      “They were playing in the garden all afternoon.” (Ongoing over a period)<br>
      “While she was cooking, he was reading a book.” (Simultaneous actions)
    </div>

    <h2>3. The Present Perfect Tense</h2>
    <p>Connects past events to the present; time is unspecified or unimportant.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Experiences:</strong> “I have visited Paris twice.”<br>
          “She has read that book.”</li>
      <li><strong>Changes Over Time:</strong> “He has grown so much since I last saw him.”<br>
          “My English has improved a lot this year.”</li>
      <li><strong>Accomplishments:</strong> “We have finished the report.”<br>
          “She has won the competition!”</li>
      <li><strong>Unfinished Actions (with for/since):</strong> “I have lived in California for ten years.”<br>
          “She has known him since childhood.”</li>
      <li><strong>Recent Past with Present Results:</strong> “I have lost my keys.”<br>
          “It has rained, so the ground is wet.”</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note">Key signals: ever, never, already, yet, just, recently, lately, so far, for, since.</p>

    <h2>4. The Past Perfect Tense</h2>
    <p>Highlights an action completed before another past action.</p>
    <div class="example">
      “I had finished my homework before my friends arrived.”<br>
      “She had never seen snow before she visited Canada.”<br>
      “By the time we got to the station, the train had already left.”
    </div>

    <h2>5. The Past Perfect Continuous Tense</h2>
    <p>Emphasizes duration of an action before another past event.</p>
    <div class="example">
      “He had been studying for hours before he took a break.”<br>
      “They had been waiting for the bus for twenty minutes when it arrived.”<br>
      “She was tired because she had been working all night.”
    </div>

    <h2>6. Using Adverbs & Time Expressions</h2>
    <p>Add clarity with words like:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Specific points:</strong> yesterday, last week, in 2010, on Tuesday, at 3 pm</li>
      <li><strong>Periods:</strong> for five years, during the summer, a long time ago</li>
      <li><strong>Sequence:</strong> first, then, after that, finally</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. “Used to” & “Would”</h2>
    <p>Describe past habits or states no longer true:</p>
    <div class="example">
      “I used to play the piano when I was younger.”<br>
      “There used to be a big tree in our yard.”<br>
      “Every summer, we would go camping in the mountains.”
    </div>

    <h2>8. Storytelling & Narrative Techniques</h2>
    <p>In narratives, mix tenses for flow—use Simple Past to set the scene, Past Continuous or Perfect for background, and Present Perfect to tie past to now.</p>

    <h2>In Summary</h2>
    <p>The best tense for talking about past events depends on:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>When</strong> the action happened (specific vs. unspecified time)</li>
      <li><strong>Completion</strong>: finished actions vs. ongoing or habitual actions</li>
      <li><strong>Duration</strong>: emphasizing length of time</li>
      <li><strong>Connection</strong> to the present or to other past events</li>
    </ul>
