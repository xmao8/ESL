  <h1>The Miracle of Dunkirk</h1>

  <article>
    <p>In <strong>1940</strong>, German soldiers moved quickly through Europe during World War II. Many British and French soldiers were trapped in a small town called <strong>Dunkirk</strong> in France. They could not escape by land because the German army was too strong. Their only way out was by sea.</p>

    <p>There were not enough navy ships to save them. So the British government asked <strong>regular people with boats</strong> to help. These boats were called <strong>“The Little Ships.”</strong> They were small fishing boats, sailboats, and even family boats.</p>

    <p>From <strong>May 26 to June 4</strong>, these boats crossed the sea between England and France. It was dangerous. German planes dropped bombs. But the little boats were brave. They helped save over <strong>338,000 soldiers</strong>.</p>

    <p>People called it the <strong>“Miracle of Dunkirk.”</strong> It was a surprise that so many men were rescued. The soldiers lost their weapons, but their lives were saved. Later, the British leader <strong>Winston Churchill</strong> gave a speech. He said, “We shall never surrender.”</p>

    <p>This story shows that ordinary people can do great things in hard times. It also shows the power of <strong>teamwork and courage</strong>.</p>
