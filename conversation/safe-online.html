<h1>Safe Online</h1>

<div class="container">
  <p class="scene-info">Setting: A coffee shop. Friends sitting around a table.</p>

  <div class="dialogue">
    <p><strong>Alex:</strong> (confident and tech-savvy)</p>
    <p><strong>Jamie:</strong> (cautious and thoughtful)</p>
    <p><strong>Pat:</strong> (inexperienced and trusting)</p>
    <p><strong>Alex:</strong> Hey everyone, looks like Pat has a question.</p>
    <p><strong>Pat:</strong> (excitedly) Hey! This person I don‚Äôt know just sent me a friend request. Says we have mutual friends. Should I accept?</p>
    <p><strong>Alex:</strong> Why not? The more, the merrier!</p>
    <p><strong>Jamie:</strong> Wait! Do you even know this person?</p>
    <p><strong>Pat:</strong> No, but it looks friendly enough. Look, we have common friends.</p>
    <p><strong>Jamie:</strong> Pat, be careful. Sometimes people pretend to be someone they're not online.</p>
    <p><strong>Alex:</strong> Jamie, come on. It‚Äôs probably harmless.</p>
    <p><strong>Jamie:</strong> It might be, Alex, but think about it‚Äîwhy take a risk?</p>
    <p><strong>Pat:</strong> What do you mean?</p>
    <p><strong>Jamie:</strong> Well, scammers often pretend to be friends to get personal information. Have you checked their profile carefully?</p>
    <p><strong>Pat:</strong> (looking at phone) Hmm... no real photos, just generic images.</p>
    <p><strong>Alex:</strong> Okay, that‚Äôs suspicious.</p>
    <p><strong>Jamie:</strong> Exactly! And they haven‚Äôt posted anything personal. It could be fake.</p>
    <p><strong>Alex:</strong> (nodding) Actually, now that I think about it, something similar happened to my cousin. She accepted a request, and soon they started asking her strange questions.</p>
    <p><strong>Pat:</strong> What kind of strange questions?</p>
    <p><strong>Alex:</strong> Personal stuff‚Äîaddress, phone number, even bank details. Luckily, she realized in time and blocked them.</p>
    <p><strong>Jamie:</strong> See, Pat? It‚Äôs easy to trust people online because everything looks normal at first. But it‚Äôs essential to pause and consider before clicking anything.</p>
    <p><strong>Pat:</strong> I never thought about it that way. But how do you know what's safe and what's not?</p>
    <p><strong>Jamie:</strong> Always look for signs. Do they have real photos or just stock images? Do they have normal interactions on their timeline, or does it seem suspiciously empty?</p>
    <p><strong>Alex:</strong> And never share personal information with strangers online. If something feels wrong, trust your instincts.</p>
    <p><strong>Pat:</strong> You're both right. Better safe than sorry. I'll decline the request.</p>
    <p><strong>Alex:</strong> Good call, Pat. Maybe I should rethink some of my online choices too!</p>
    <p><strong>Jamie:</strong> Definitely. And always remember: Think before you click!</p>
    <p><strong>Pat:</strong> (smiling and tapping screen) Declined! Lesson learned.</p>
    <p><strong>Alex:</strong> By the way, Jamie, have you ever had a weird online experience?</p>
    <p><strong>Jamie:</strong> Yes, actually. I once got an email from a supposed "bank" asking for urgent updates to my account details.</p>
    <p><strong>Pat:</strong> Did you reply?</p>
    <p><strong>Jamie:</strong> No, I hesitated and noticed some strange spelling errors. That raised a red flag. I contacted my real bank directly, and they confirmed it was a scam.</p>
    <p><strong>Alex:</strong> Wow, good thing you noticed those details. Little things like spelling mistakes can really help identify fraud.</p>
    <p><strong>Pat:</strong> True, scammers can be pretty clever, but they usually slip up in small ways.</p>
    <p><strong>Jamie:</strong> Exactly! Always double-check with official sources before sharing sensitive information.</p>
    <p><strong>Alex:</strong> And talk to friends or family if you‚Äôre unsure. A quick chat can make a big difference.</p>
    <p><strong>Pat:</strong> Thanks, both of you. I'm feeling a lot smarter about online safety already!</p>
    <p><strong>Jamie:</strong> Glad to hear it, Pat. Staying safe online takes just a little vigilance.</p>
    <p><strong>Alex:</strong> (raising coffee cup) To staying safe online!</p>
    <p><strong>All together:</strong> To staying safe online!</p>
    <p>(They laugh and continue their relaxed conversation.)</p>
