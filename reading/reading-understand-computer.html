    <h1>Understanding Your Computer: A Guide for ESL Learners</h1>

    <div class="container">
        <p>Computers are everywhere today! From your smartphone to the large screen at the bank, technology helps us with many daily tasks. For adult English as a Second Language (ESL) students, understanding computers is a valuable skill that can open many doors, whether for work, education, or connecting with family and friends.</p>
        <p>You probably already know how to turn a computer on and use a mouse or keyboard. But let's look a little deeper into how computers work and some important vocabulary.</p>

        <div class="article-section">
            <h2>Hardware vs. Software</h2>
            <p>Imagine a computer like a car. The <strong>hardware</strong> is all the physical parts you can touch: the screen, keyboard, mouse, and the main box (often called the "tower" for a desktop computer, or it's built into your <strong>laptop</strong>). Inside the tower or laptop, there are many parts, like the <strong>CPU</strong> (Central Processing Unit), which is like the computer's brain, and <strong>RAM</strong> (Random Access Memory), which helps the computer think quickly.</p>
            <p><strong>Software</strong>, on the other hand, is the set of instructions or programs that tell the hardware what to do. You can't touch software. Think of the car's engine manual or the music on the radio – those are like software. Common software includes your <strong>operating system</strong> (like Windows or macOS), <strong>web browsers</strong> (like Chrome or Firefox for going online), and <strong>applications</strong> or "apps" (like Word for writing, or Zoom for video calls).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="article-section">
            <h2>Everyday Computer Skills</h2>
            <p>Using a computer effectively involves several key skills. You need to know how to <strong>save</strong> your work, usually into a <strong>file</strong> or a <strong>folder</strong> on your computer's <strong>hard drive</strong>. It’s like organizing your papers in different folders in a cabinet.</p>
            <p>When you want to go online, you open a <strong>web browser</strong>. The internet allows you to <strong>search</strong> for information, <strong>send emails</strong>, or <strong>browse</strong> websites. Always remember to use a <strong>strong password</strong> to protect your accounts and keep your personal information safe. A strong password often uses a mix of capital and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.</p>
            <p>If you have a problem, like a program freezing, don't worry. Sometimes, restarting the program or even the whole computer can fix it. Learning to <strong>troubleshoot</strong> small problems is a part of becoming more comfortable with technology.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="article-section">
            <h2>Why Computer Knowledge Matters</h2>
            <p>Improving your computer knowledge helps you participate more fully in modern life. You can communicate more easily, find jobs that require digital skills, and access a vast amount of information. Don't be afraid to try new things and ask questions. Every expert was once a beginner. Keep practicing, and your computer skills will grow!</p>
