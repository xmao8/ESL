            <h2>Article for Intermediate ESL Adults</h2>

            <p>Martin Luther King Jr. was one of the most important leaders in American history. He is best known for his work in the Civil Rights Movement, which fought for equal rights for African Americans in the United States. Through peaceful protest, powerful speeches, and strong moral beliefs, King helped change laws and attitudes about race and equality.</p>

            <p>Martin Luther King Jr. was born in 1929 in Atlanta, Georgia. He grew up during a time when segregation was common. Segregation meant that Black and white people were separated in schools, buses, restaurants, and many other public places. Black Americans often faced unfair treatment, limited opportunities, and violence. From a young age, King saw this injustice and wanted to make society fairer.</p>

            <p>King became a Baptist minister, like his father. His religious beliefs strongly influenced his ideas about justice and equality. He believed that all people are equal and deserve respect, no matter their skin color. He also believed in nonviolence, which means protesting without using physical force or harm. King was inspired by Mahatma Gandhi, who used peaceful methods to fight injustice in India.</p>

            <p>One of King’s first major roles in the Civil Rights Movement was during the Montgomery Bus Boycott in 1955. After Rosa Parks was arrested for refusing to give up her seat to a white passenger, Black citizens stopped using the city buses. King became the leader of this boycott, which lasted over a year. In the end, segregation on buses was declared illegal. This success showed that peaceful protest could bring real change.</p>

            <p>Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, King led marches, speeches, and demonstrations across the country. He encouraged people to protest unfair laws calmly and bravely, even when they faced danger. Many protesters were arrested, attacked, or threatened, but King continued to believe that love and nonviolence were stronger than hate.</p>

            <p>One of King’s most famous moments was his “I Have a Dream” speech in 1963. He gave this speech during the March on Washington, in front of hundreds of thousands of people. In the speech, King shared his dream of a future where people are judged by their character, not by the color of their skin. His words inspired millions and became a symbol of hope and equality.</p>

            <p>King’s work helped lead to important changes, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. These laws ended legal segregation and protected voting rights for African Americans. In 1964, King received the Nobel Peace Prize for his commitment to nonviolent action.</p>

            <p>Sadly, Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in 1968. However, his ideas and message continue to influence people around the world. Today, he is remembered as a leader who stood for justice, equality, and peace. His life teaches us that courage, kindness, and peaceful action can help change society for the better.</p>
