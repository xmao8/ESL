    <h1>Confucius and His Teachings</h1>

    <main>
        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>The Teacher of China</h2>
            <p>More than 2,500 years ago, during the Spring and Autumn Period, a man named <em>Confucius</em> was born in Qufu, in the state of Lu. He grew up in a time when China was divided into many small states that often fought wars. Confucius dreamed of a peaceful and fair society.</p>
            <p>Confucius was not a king or a soldier. He was a teacher and a thinker. He believed that respect, kindness, and good behavior were the keys to harmony. He taught that children should honor their parents, rulers should care for their people, and friends should be loyal to one another.</p>
            <p>He also said that learning was very important. ‚ÄúStudy the past,‚Äù he told his students, ‚Äúto understand the present.‚Äù His words were written down in a book called the <em>Analects</em>. These teachings became the foundation of <strong>Confucianism</strong>.</p>
            <p>At first, Confucius had trouble finding leaders who would follow his advice. He traveled from state to state, offering his ideas, but many rulers ignored him. Still, he continued teaching his students. Over time, his ideas spread widely.</p>
            <p>Hundreds of years later, Chinese emperors used Confucianism to guide the government. Officials studied his teachings and had to pass exams based on them. His influence shaped Chinese education, politics, and family life for centuries.</p>
            <p>Today, people around the world still read Confucius‚Äôs sayings. His wisdom about respect, honesty, and learning continues to inspire us. Although he lived long ago, Confucius‚Äôs dream of harmony still speaks to the modern world.</p>
