    <h1>The Journey of Lewis and Clark: Exploring the Unknown (1804–1806)</h1>

    <main>
        <!-- Reading Text -->
        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Opening the West</h2>
            <p>
                Imagine a vast, unknown land stretching west, full of mountains, rivers, and animals no European had ever
                seen. After the United States bought the <strong>Louisiana Territory</strong> from France in 1803,
                President <strong>Thomas Jefferson</strong> wanted to learn more about this new land. He decided to send
                an expedition to explore it and to look for a water route to the Pacific Ocean. He chose two brave men to
                lead the mission: <strong>Meriwether Lewis</strong> and <strong>William Clark</strong>.
            </p>

            <h2>The Expedition Begins</h2>
            <p>
                In May 1804, the group called the <strong>Corps of Discovery</strong> set off from St. Louis, a city on
                the Mississippi River. They traveled up the Missouri River in a large boat and several canoes. Their
                journey was incredibly difficult. Strong <strong>currents</strong> pushed against them, and they had to
                pull the boats with ropes. They faced dangerous animals like <strong>grizzly bears</strong> and had to
                survive hot summers and freezing winters.
            </p>

            <h2>Key Figures: Sacagawea</h2>
            <p>
                One of the most important members of the expedition was <strong>Sacagawea</strong>, a young Shoshone
                woman. She joined the expedition with her baby and her husband. Sacagawea helped guide the group through
                difficult <strong>terrain</strong>, showed them which plants were safe to eat, and acted as an
                <strong>interpreter</strong> when they met Native American tribes. Because a woman with a baby was
                traveling with them, many tribes understood that the expedition was peaceful, not a war party.
            </p>

            <h2>Reaching the Pacific Ocean</h2>
            <p>
                After more than a year of travel, climbing mountains and following rivers, the expedition finally reached
                the <strong>Pacific Ocean</strong> in November 1805. They built a small fort called Fort Clatsop on the
                coast and spent the winter there. The weather was cold and rainy, but they used the time to rest, hunt,
                and prepare for the journey back.
            </p>

            <h2>Homeward Journey and Legacy</h2>
            <p>
                In the spring, Lewis and Clark led the Corps of Discovery back toward St. Louis. They returned in
                September 1806, having traveled thousands of miles. They had <strong>mapped</strong> new territories and
                recorded hundreds of new species of plants and animals. Their journey opened the door for
                <strong>westward expansion</strong> and helped Americans understand the size and richness of their
                newly acquired land. The expedition also created important relationships—both positive and negative—with
                many Native American nations. Today, Lewis and Clark are remembered as key figures in the early history
                of the United States.
