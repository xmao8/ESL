    <h1>Hephaestus — God of Fire and Craftsmanship</h1>

    <main>
        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>The Master of the Forge</h2>
            <p>In ancient Greek mythology, <strong>Hephaestus</strong> was the god of fire, metalworking, and craftsmanship. He was known as the divine blacksmith, creating weapons, armor, and tools for both gods and heroes. Although he was not as handsome or strong as other gods, his intelligence, creativity, and skill made him one of the most respected figures on Mount Olympus. He represented the power of hard work and the beauty of human invention.</p>
            <p>Hephaestus was the son of <strong>Zeus</strong> and <strong>Hera</strong>. Some myths say that he was born weak and deformed, and that Hera, ashamed of his appearance, threw him from Mount Olympus into the sea. He landed with such force that he was injured and became lame. Despite this cruelty, Hephaestus survived and grew up under the care of sea nymphs, who taught him patience and craftsmanship. Using his clever hands, he learned to shape metal with fire, creating objects of great beauty and power.</p>
            <p>When Hephaestus grew older, he returned to Olympus to claim his place among the gods. To win Hera’s forgiveness, he presented her with a magnificent golden throne. However, when she sat on it, she became trapped by invisible chains that only Hephaestus could unlock. The other gods begged him to release her, and finally, <strong>Dionysus</strong>, the god of wine, convinced him with kindness and celebration. When Hephaestus returned, he freed Hera and was welcomed back with honor.</p>
            <p>Hephaestus built his workshop beneath volcanoes, where the fire and heat fueled his creations. With the help of mechanical servants made of gold, he forged armor for <strong>Achilles</strong>, the thunderbolts of <strong>Zeus</strong>, and the weapons of many other gods. His skill was unmatched—everything he made was both useful and beautiful. The Romans later called him <strong>Vulcan</strong>, and from his name comes the word “volcano.”</p>
            <p>Hephaestus was married to <strong>Aphrodite</strong>, the goddess of love and beauty. It was a strange pairing: the graceful goddess and the humble craftsman. Their marriage, arranged by Zeus, was often troubled because Aphrodite loved <strong>Ares</strong>, the god of war. When Hephaestus discovered their affair, he crafted an invisible net and trapped them, exposing their disloyalty to all the gods. This story showed Hephaestus’s intelligence and also his deep sense of justice.</p>
            <p>Unlike many other gods, Hephaestus valued work over pride. He showed that even those who are rejected or different can create greatness through effort and creativity. To the Greeks, he symbolized endurance, invention, and the dignity of labor. Every time a craftsman struck metal with a hammer, they were said to be guided by Hephaestus’s spirit. His story teaches that true strength lies not in appearance, but in skill, patience, and the will to create something lasting.</p>
