    <h1>Ares — God of War</h1>

    <main>
        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>The Fierce Spirit of Battle</h2>
            <p>In ancient Greek mythology, <strong>Ares</strong> was the god of war. He represented the physical strength, courage, and violence of battle. While other gods like <strong>Athena</strong> symbolized wisdom and strategy in war, Ares embodied the raw energy and chaos of fighting. The Greeks respected his power but also feared his uncontrollable nature. To them, Ares showed both the bravery and the brutality that come with conflict.</p>
            <p>Ares was the son of <strong>Zeus</strong> and <strong>Hera</strong>, the king and queen of the gods. From the beginning, he was strong and fearless, always eager for combat. He carried a spear and a shield and often wore armor made of shining bronze. Wherever Ares went, the sound of battle followed—he was accompanied by fierce spirits like <strong>Phobos</strong> (fear) and <strong>Deimos</strong> (terror), who spread panic among his enemies. His war chariot was pulled by four fire-breathing horses that thundered across the battlefield.</p>
            <p>Despite his strength, Ares was not always admired. The Greeks valued intelligence and balance, and they saw Ares as impulsive and emotional. He often acted before thinking, rushing into fights even when they were unnecessary. This caused trouble for both gods and humans. However, his bravery and loyalty were undeniable. In times of war, he fought fiercely for those he supported, showing courage even when the odds were against him.</p>
            <p>One of the most famous stories about Ares involves his love affair with <strong>Aphrodite</strong>, the goddess of love and beauty. Although she was married to <strong>Hephaestus</strong>, the god of fire, she and Ares shared a passionate but secret romance. When the other gods discovered their affair, they were trapped and exposed by Hephaestus, who caught them in a magical net. The story of Ares and Aphrodite showed how love and war, two opposite forces, are often connected in human life—both powerful and unpredictable.</p>
            <p>Ares also played a role in many legendary battles, including the <strong>Trojan War</strong>. He fought on the side of the Trojans but was wounded by the Greek hero <strong>Diomedes</strong> with the help of Athena. Even gods could be hurt, and this moment reminded the Greeks that violence always has a cost. Ares was immortal, but his pain represented the suffering that comes from war and aggression.</p>
            <p>In Rome, Ares was known as <strong>Mars</strong>, and his image changed. The Romans viewed Mars as a noble and protective god of soldiers and the father of their people. They admired his courage more than his rage. Through this transformation, Ares’s story shows how cultures can shape the meaning of power and heroism.</p>
            <p>To the ancient Greeks, Ares was a warning about the dangers of uncontrolled anger. He represented the passion that drives people to fight but also the destruction that follows. His myth teaches that strength without wisdom can lead to chaos. Even today, Ares reminds us that courage and control must work together if we want peace to last.</p>
