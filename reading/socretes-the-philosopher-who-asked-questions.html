    <h1>Socrates — The Philosopher Who Asked Questions</h1>

            <h2>Article for Intermediate ESL Adults</h2>

            <p>Socrates is one of the most famous philosophers in history. He lived in ancient Greece, in the city of Athens, around 2,400 years ago. Even today, people study his ideas in schools and universities around the world. Socrates did not write any books himself, but his thoughts and teachings were recorded by his students, especially Plato. Socrates is remembered not for giving answers, but for asking powerful questions.</p>

            <p>Socrates believed that asking questions was the best way to learn. He often talked with people in public places like markets and streets. He asked them questions about important ideas such as justice, happiness, courage, and truth. At first, people felt confident answering him. However, as Socrates continued asking deeper questions, many realized that they did not fully understand what they thought they knew. This method of teaching is now called the Socratic Method. It helps people think more carefully and clearly.</p>

            <p>One famous idea of Socrates is: “I know that I know nothing.” By this, he did not mean that he was ignorant or stupid. Instead, he meant that true wisdom comes from recognizing our own lack of knowledge. Socrates believed that many people thought they were wise, but they never questioned their beliefs. For him, being honest about what we do not know is the first step toward real learning.</p>

            <p>Socrates also believed strongly in moral values. He thought that living a good life was more important than money, power, or fame. According to Socrates, people should care for their soul by being honest, fair, and kind. He believed that doing something wrong hurts the person who does it more than anyone else. For this reason, he said that it is better to suffer injustice than to commit it.</p>

            <p>Not everyone liked Socrates. Some powerful people in Athens felt uncomfortable with his questions. They believed he was confusing young people and challenging traditional beliefs. Eventually, Socrates was put on trial. He was accused of not respecting the city’s gods and of corrupting the youth. Even during his trial, Socrates continued to speak honestly and ask questions.</p>

            <p>Socrates was found guilty and sentenced to death. He was given a choice: stop teaching or accept the punishment. Socrates refused to change his beliefs. He believed that staying true to his principles was more important than saving his life. He calmly accepted his sentence and died by drinking poison. His death made him a symbol of courage, integrity, and freedom of thought.</p>

            <p>Today, Socrates is remembered as a philosopher who taught people how to think, not what to think. His ideas continue to influence philosophy, education, and critical thinking. For ESL learners and others, Socrates reminds us that asking questions, being curious, and thinking deeply are important skills—not only in learning, but in life.</p>
