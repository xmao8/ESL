  <h1>Both...and... &amp; Neither...nor...</h1>

  <div class="container">
    <p><strong>"Both...and..."</strong> and <strong>"Neither...nor..."</strong> are really useful conjunctions that help us connect two ideas or items in a sentence. They're great for showing relationships between things, whether it's inclusion or exclusion.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Both . . . and . . .</h2>
    <p>We use <strong>"both...and..."</strong> to emphasize that <strong>two subjects, objects, or ideas are true or apply.</strong> It's like saying "this one <em>plus</em> that one."</p>
    <p><strong>Here's how it works:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Connecting two subjects:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Both</strong> my brother <strong>and</strong> my sister enjoy hiking. (This means my brother enjoys hiking, and my sister also enjoys hiking.)</li>
          <li><strong>Both</strong> the book <strong>and</strong> the movie were excellent. (The book was excellent, and the movie was excellent.)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Connecting two objects:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>She speaks <strong>both</strong> English <strong>and</strong> Spanish fluently. (She speaks English, and she speaks Spanish.)</li>
          <li>He likes <strong>both</strong> pizza <strong>and</strong> pasta for dinner. (He likes pizza, and he likes pasta.)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Connecting two verbs/actions:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>He <strong>both</strong> works <strong>and</strong> studies full-time. (He works full-time, and he studies full-time.)</li>
          <li>The new software is <strong>both</strong> fast <strong>and</strong> efficient. (It is fast, and it is efficient.)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="important">Important Note: When "both...and..." connects two subjects, the verb that follows is always <strong>plural</strong>.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Neither . . . nor . . .</h2>
    <p>On the other hand, <strong>"neither...nor..."</strong> is used to show that <strong>two subjects, objects, or ideas are <em>not</em> true or do <em>not</em> apply.</strong> It's the opposite of "both...and..." and means "not this one <em>and</em> not that one."</p>
    <p><strong>Here's how it works:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Connecting two subjects:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Neither</strong> John <strong>nor</strong> Sarah was at the party. (John was not at the party, and Sarah was not at the party.)</li>
          <li><strong>Neither</strong> the red shirt <strong>nor</strong> the blue shirt fits me. (The red shirt doesn't fit, and the blue shirt doesn't fit.)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Connecting two objects:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>I like <strong>neither</strong> strong coffee <strong>nor</strong> sweet tea. (I don't like strong coffee, and I don't like sweet tea.)</li>
          <li>She plays <strong>neither</strong> tennis <strong>nor</strong> golf. (She doesn't play tennis, and she doesn't play golf.)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Connecting two verbs/actions:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>He can <strong>neither</strong> sing <strong>nor</strong> dance well. (He can't sing well, and he can't dance well.)</li>
          <li>The problem was <strong>neither</strong> simple <strong>nor</strong> easy to solve. (It wasn't simple, and it wasn't easy.)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="important">Important Note: When "neither...nor..." connects two subjects, the verb typically agrees with the <strong>second subject</strong> (the one closer to the verb).</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Neither the students <strong>nor</strong> the teacher <strong>is</strong> ready. (The teacher is singular, so "is" is used.)</li>
      <li>Neither the teacher <strong>nor</strong> the students <strong>are</strong> ready. (The students are plural, so "are" is used.)</li>
    </ul>
