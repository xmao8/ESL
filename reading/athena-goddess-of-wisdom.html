    <h1>Athena — Goddess of Wisdom and War</h1>

    <main>
        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>The Wise Warrior of Mount Olympus</h2>
            <p>In ancient Greek mythology, <strong>Athena</strong> was one of the most admired and respected gods. She was the goddess of wisdom, war strategy, and crafts. Unlike other gods who often acted with emotion, Athena represented intelligence, balance, and fairness. She was a symbol of both strength and wisdom—a warrior who used her mind as much as her sword.</p>
            <p>Athena’s birth was unusual and full of mystery. According to legend, she was born fully grown and dressed in shining armor from the forehead of her father, <strong>Zeus</strong>. It happened after Zeus suffered a terrible headache. When his head split open, Athena appeared with a loud cry, holding a spear and shield. The other gods were amazed at her beauty and power.</p>
            <p>Athena quickly became known as the protector of cities and the guide of heroes. She helped many famous figures in Greek mythology, including <em>Perseus</em>, who defeated the monster <em>Medusa</em>, and <em>Odysseus</em>, who found his way home after the Trojan War. She gave them advice, courage, and clever plans to overcome impossible challenges. Because of her wisdom and justice, people often prayed to her for good decisions and peace in times of conflict.</p>
            <p>One of the most famous stories about Athena is how she became the guardian of the city of <strong>Athens</strong>. Both Athena and <strong>Poseidon</strong> wanted to be the city’s patron god. To decide, they each offered a gift to the people. Poseidon struck the ground with his trident and created a saltwater spring, while Athena planted the first olive tree. The people chose Athena’s gift because the olive tree provided food, oil, and wood. In honor of her, the city was named Athens, and the grand temple known as the <strong>Parthenon</strong> was built to celebrate her.</p>
            <p>Athena was also known for her love of learning and the arts. She was the patron of craftsmen, artists, and teachers. The owl, her sacred animal, symbolized wisdom and careful observation. Unlike <strong>Ares</strong>, the god of war who enjoyed fighting, Athena represented the smart and fair side of war—planning, strategy, and protection rather than destruction.</p>
            <p>Although she was strong, Athena valued peace more than violence. She taught humans to use reason instead of anger and to solve problems through discussion and intelligence. In many myths, she helped end wars and bring justice. She was admired by men and women alike for her fairness and independence, standing as a model of self-control and confidence.</p>
            <p>Even today, Athena remains a symbol of wisdom and courage. Statues of her stand in many cities, and her image appears in books, art, and even modern education logos. The ancient Greeks saw her as a reminder that true power comes not only from strength but also from knowledge and the wisdom to use it well.</p>
