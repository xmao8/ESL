    <h1>The Declaration of Independence — The Birth of a Nation</h1>

            <h2>The Document That Changed History</h2>
            <p>The <strong>Declaration of Independence</strong> is one of the most important documents in American history. It was written to announce that the thirteen American colonies were breaking away from British rule and forming their own nation — the United States of America. Signed on <strong>July 4, 1776</strong>, the Declaration marked the beginning of a new era of freedom, equality, and self-government.</p>
            <p>Before independence, the colonies were under the control of <strong>King George III</strong> of Great Britain. Over time, tensions grew because the colonists were taxed heavily without having any representatives in the British Parliament. They protested with the phrase, “<strong>No taxation without representation</strong>.” The colonies wanted to make their own laws and govern themselves, but the British government refused. Eventually, the conflict led to the <strong>American Revolutionary War</strong> in 1775.</p>
            <p>In 1776, the <strong>Second Continental Congress</strong> met in Philadelphia to decide the colonies’ future. A young Virginian named <strong>Thomas Jefferson</strong> was chosen to write the Declaration. He worked with a committee that included <strong>John Adams</strong>, <strong>Benjamin Franklin</strong>, and others. Jefferson’s words were powerful and clear, expressing the desire for freedom and human rights.</p>
            <p>The Declaration begins with one of the most famous lines in history: “<em>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.</em>” These words express the belief that every person has basic rights that cannot be taken away by any government.</p>
            <p>The document then lists the many ways King George III had treated the colonies unfairly — such as imposing taxes, limiting trade, and sending soldiers without consent. The colonists declared that they had the right to separate from Britain because the king had broken his trust. They claimed the freedom to form a new, independent government that would protect their rights and represent their people.</p>
            <p>On July 4, 1776, representatives from all thirteen colonies approved and signed the Declaration of Independence. That day became known as <strong>Independence Day</strong>, celebrated every year with fireworks, parades, and patriotic speeches. It marks the birth of the United States as a free nation.</p>
            <p>The Declaration of Independence continues to inspire people around the world. Its message of equality, justice, and the right to self-determination has influenced other countries and movements for human rights. It reminds everyone that freedom is a universal value — one that must be protected and cherished. For Americans, it remains a symbol of hope, courage, and the power of ideas to change the world.</p>
