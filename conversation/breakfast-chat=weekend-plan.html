<h1>Breakfast Chat: Weekend Plans</h1>

<div class="container">
  <p class="scene-info">Setting: A kitchen table, morning. Maria is pouring coffee, David is reading a newspaper section, Lena is looking at her phone.</p>

  <div class="dialogue">
    <p><strong>Maria:</strong> Good morning, everyone! Coffee's ready. Smells good, right?</p>
    <p><strong>David:</strong> Morning, Maria. Thanks! (Puts down the paper) Ah, much needed. So, any exciting plans for the weekend? It feels like ages since the last one.</p>
    <p><strong>Lena:</strong> Good morning! Not too exciting yet, David. I‚Äôm just trying to organize my errands. I have to go to the grocery store, and then I need to drop off some clothes at the dry cleaner's. Very thrilling. (She smiles lightly.)</p>
    <p><strong>Maria:</strong> Oh, errands! I have a few too. I need to buy some new shoes. My old ones are completely worn out from all my walking. Maybe I‚Äôll go to the mall on Saturday. Does anyone want to come along? It‚Äôs always more fun with company.</p>
    <p><strong>David:</strong> Hmm, the mall‚Ä¶ I don't usually enjoy shopping very much, but I <em>do</em> need a new book. Maybe I could browse the bookstore there. What kind of shoes are you looking for, Maria? Casual or something for work?</p>
    <p><strong>Maria:</strong> Just casual ones this time, for everyday wear. Something comfortable. And Lena, you mentioned groceries? I was thinking of trying that new international market on Elm Street. Have you been there? I heard they have amazing fresh vegetables.</p>
    <p><strong>Lena:</strong> Oh, the international market! I've heard good things too. My neighbor told me their prices are really good. I was planning to go to my usual supermarket, but that sounds like a much better idea. Yes, I'd definitely be interested in joining you, Maria. What time were you thinking?</p>
    <p><strong>Maria:</strong> How about Saturday morning, around 10:00 AM? We could meet there, or if it's easier, we could share a ride. My car is big enough.</p>
    <p><strong>David:</strong> If you two are going to the market, I might skip the mall and just go to my local bookstore. The mall can get very crowded on weekends. But perhaps we could all meet for lunch afterwards? Maybe somewhere near the international market?</p>
    <p><strong>Lena:</strong> That‚Äôs a great idea, David! I know a nice little caf√© called "The Daily Grind" not too far from Elm Street. They have delicious sandwiches and really good coffee. It‚Äôs usually not too busy around lunchtime on Saturdays.</p>
    <p><strong>Maria:</strong> Perfect! So, Lena and I will go to the international market around 10:00 AM on Saturday. And David, you can meet us at "The Daily Grind" caf√© around 12:30 PM for lunch. How does that sound to everyone?</p>
    <p><strong>David:</strong> Sounds perfect to me. A good book and then good company for lunch. Much better than fighting the mall crowds.</p>
    <p><strong>Lena:</strong> Agreed. And I'll finally get to check out that international market. Thanks for the suggestion, Maria!</p>
    <p><strong>Maria:</strong> No problem! I‚Äôm looking forward to it. Now, who wants more coffee?</p>
    <p>(Maria picks up the coffee pot, and everyone smiles.)</p>
