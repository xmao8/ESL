    <h1>Aphrodite — Goddess of Love and Beauty</h1>

    <main>
        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>The Power of Love and Desire</h2>
            <p>In ancient Greek mythology, <strong>Aphrodite</strong> was the goddess of love, beauty, and desire. She was one of the most powerful and admired goddesses on Mount Olympus. Her presence brought charm, attraction, and emotion to gods and humans alike. The Greeks believed that love was one of the strongest forces in the world—and Aphrodite was its divine source.</p>
            <p>According to legend, Aphrodite was born from the sea. When the god <strong>Cronus</strong> defeated his father Uranus, pieces of the sky fell into the ocean, and from the sea foam rose Aphrodite, glowing with beauty. She floated to shore on a seashell, arriving on the island of <strong>Cyprus</strong>. The winds carried her gently to land, and flowers bloomed wherever she stepped. Because of this, she was also called “the foam-born goddess.”</p>
            <p>From the moment she appeared, all the gods admired her. Even <strong>Zeus</strong> feared the power of her beauty, which could cause both peace and conflict. To prevent competition among the gods, Zeus decided she should marry <strong>Hephaestus</strong>, the god of fire and metalwork. Although he was kind and skilled, Hephaestus was not handsome. Aphrodite, full of passion, often fell in love with others—most famously with <strong>Ares</strong>, the god of war. Their love symbolized the powerful but dangerous combination of beauty and conflict.</p>
            <p>Aphrodite had many children, the most famous being <strong>Eros</strong> (known to Romans as Cupid), the playful god of love. With his magical bow and arrows, Eros made gods and humans fall in love unexpectedly. Together, mother and son represented how love can bring joy but also cause trouble and confusion.</p>
            <p>Although Aphrodite was often described as gentle and kind, she could also be proud and jealous. In one famous story, a Trojan prince named <strong>Paris</strong> was asked to choose the most beautiful goddess among Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite. Each offered him a gift: Hera promised power, Athena promised wisdom, and Aphrodite promised the love of the most beautiful woman in the world. Paris chose Aphrodite, who gave him <strong>Helen of Troy</strong>—but Helen was already married. This choice led to the great <strong>Trojan War</strong>, showing how love’s power could start both joy and destruction.</p>
            <p>Despite her flaws, Aphrodite symbolized more than romantic love. She also represented creativity, fertility, and the connection between nature and emotion. Her temples were filled with flowers, music, and art celebrating beauty in all its forms. She taught that love could inspire kindness, bring harmony, and make life meaningful.</p>
            <p>Even today, Aphrodite’s name remains a symbol of love and beauty. Her image appears in famous art, such as the statue <em>Venus de Milo</em>, and her stories remind us that love can be both a gift and a challenge. Through her, the ancient Greeks expressed one timeless truth: love is the most human—and divine—force of all.</p>
