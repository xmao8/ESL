    <h1>The Redwood Forests ‚Äî Giants of the Earth</h1>

    <main>
        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Home of the Tallest Trees</h2>
            <p>The Redwood Forests of California, USA, are home to the tallest trees in the world. These giant trees, called coast redwoods, can grow over 115 meters tall, taller than a 35-story building. Some are more than 2,000 years old, making them living witnesses to history. Walking through a redwood forest feels like entering a natural cathedral, with trunks like pillars and sunlight streaming through the high canopy.</p>
            <p>Redwoods grow mainly along the Pacific coast, where the climate is cool, wet, and foggy. They depend on fog for survival, absorbing water through their leaves when rainfall is low. Their thick bark protects them from fire and insects, while their shallow but wide root systems allow them to stand strong against storms.</p>
            <p>These forests are not only impressive but also important for the planet. Redwoods absorb huge amounts of carbon dioxide, helping to slow climate change. They provide habitats for many animals, including black bears, owls, banana slugs, and deer. In the rivers that flow through the forests, salmon swim upstream to lay eggs, continuing an ancient cycle of life.</p>
            <p>For Indigenous peoples of California, such as the Yurok and Tolowa, the redwoods are sacred. They used the trees for shelter, canoes, and ceremonies, always respecting the forest. Today, redwood parks protect both natural beauty and cultural traditions, welcoming visitors from around the world.</p>
            <p>In the 1800s, many redwoods were cut down for lumber, and only about 5% of the original forests remain. Conservation efforts in the 20th century helped save large areas, creating national and state parks. Redwood National and State Parks are now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, recognized for their global importance.</p>
            <p>Visitors can explore the redwood forests by hiking, camping, or driving along scenic routes. Some trails lead to famous trees like Hyperion, the tallest known living tree on Earth. Although its exact location is kept secret to protect it, the mystery adds to the wonder. Standing among these giants, people often feel both small and inspired, reminded of nature‚Äôs strength and endurance.</p>
            <p>The redwoods face modern challenges, including climate change, drought, and wildfires. Scientists and park rangers work hard to study and protect these ecosystems. Efforts focus on restoring damaged forests, preserving wildlife, and reducing human impact. Protecting the redwoods is not just about saving trees but about keeping alive a piece of Earth‚Äôs natural heritage.</p>
            <p>The Redwood Forests are a symbol of resilience and majesty. They remind us that nature can reach incredible heights when given the chance. By caring for these forests, humanity ensures that future generations can walk among the world‚Äôs tallest trees and feel the same awe and respect.</p>
