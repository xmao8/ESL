  <h1>The Step Towards Freedom</h1>
  <div class="container">
    <p><strong>A True Story of the Declaration of Independence</strong></p>
    <p>In the hot summer of 1776, Philadelphia was buzzing with excitement. The thirteen American colonies had been unhappy with British rule for a long time. They had many complaints, and now it was time for a huge decision. It wasn't just about taxes anymore; it was about being free and ruling themselves.</p>
    <p>The leaders met in the Pennsylvania State House, now called Independence Hall. For months, they had talked and argued, even hoping to make peace with the King. But that hope was gone. They now strongly believed they had to break away from Great Britain completely.</p>
    <p>The big moment came on June 7, 1776. Richard Henry Lee from Virginia stood up and said a plan: "That these United Colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent States." These brave words were a direct challenge to the powerful British Empire.</p>
    <p>The leaders knew this meant war. They needed a formal paper to explain their reasons to the world and get support. So, they chose a special "Committee of Five" to write it: John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Roger Sherman, Robert Livingston, and a smart young man named Thomas Jefferson.</p>
    <p>Jefferson, only 33, did most of the writing. He worked in his rented rooms, using a small desk. He was inspired by thinkers like John Locke, who wrote about natural rights. For 17 days, Jefferson carefully wrote about "Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness."</p>
    <p>His first draft was a strong statement about human rights. It said all people are created equal and have rights that cannot be taken away. It also listed many problems caused by King George III. Jefferson's first draft even strongly criticized the slave trade, blaming the King.</p>
    <p>When the draft was shown to the full group, there were big arguments. Every word was checked and changed. For two days, from July 2nd to July 4th, they made many edits. The biggest change was removing the part about slavery. Southern leaders, who depended on enslaved labor, strongly disagreed. Northern leaders knew they needed everyone's agreement to win the war. So, the part about slavery was removed.</p>
    <p>Even with changes, the main message of freedom stayed strong. On July 2, 1776, the Congress voted yes to Lee's plan for independence. The colonies were officially free! Two days later, on July 4, 1776, after final changes, the Congress officially accepted the words of the Declaration of Independence. John Hancock, the leader, signed it first with a very big signature.</p>
    <p>All 56 leaders didn't sign it until August 2, 1776. But July 4th, when the document was accepted, became the famous birthday of the United States. Each signature was a very brave act. These men knew if the revolution failed, they would be seen as traitors and likely killed.</p>
    <p>The Declaration of Independence was more than just a letter to a king. It was a key document, a new idea about human rights and people ruling themselves. Its powerful ideas inspired many freedom movements around the world. It laid out the main ideas for the United States, ideas that still guide the country today.</p>
